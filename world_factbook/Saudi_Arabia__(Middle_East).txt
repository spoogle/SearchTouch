Saudi Arabia  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Saudi Arabia




Background:


Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to Islam's two
holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official title is
the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi state was
founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD (Ibn Saud)
after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian Peninsula. A
male descendent of Ibn Saud, his son ABDALLAH bin Abd al-Aziz, rules
the country today as required by the country's 1992 Basic Law.
Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia accepted
the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while allowing Western
and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the liberation of Kuwait
the following year. The continuing presence of foreign troops on
Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a source of tension
between the royal family and the public until all operational US
troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist attacks in May and
November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign against domestic
terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has continued the cautious
reform program begun when he was crown prince. To promote increased
political participation, the government held elections nationwide
from February through April 2005 for half the members of 179
municipal councils. In December 2005, King ABDALLAH completed the
process by appointing the remaining members of the advisory
municipal councils. The king instituted an Inter-Faith Dialogue
initiative in 2008 to encourage religious tolerance on a global
level; in February 2009, he reshuffled the cabinet, which led to
more moderates holding ministerial and judicial positions, and
appointed the first female to the cabinet. The country remains a
leading producer of oil and natural gas and holds more than 20% of
the world's proven oil reserves. The government continues to pursue
economic reform and diversification, particularly since Saudi
Arabia's accession to the WTO in December 2005, and promotes foreign
investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning population, aquifer
depletion, and an economy largely dependent on petroleum output and
prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.

Economy ::Saudi Arabia




Economy - overview:


Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong government
controls over major economic activities. It possesses about 20% of
the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the largest exporter
of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The petroleum sector
accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of GDP, and 90% of
export earnings. Saudi Arabia is encouraging the growth of the
private sector in order to diversify its economy and to employ more
Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing on power
generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration, and
petrochemical sectors. Almost 6 million foreign workers play an
important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and
service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment
among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on
employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the
education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has
substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most
recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science
and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As
part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia
acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of
negotiations. The government has begun establishing six "economic
cities" in different regions of the country to promote foreign
investment and plans to spend $373 billion between 2010 and 2014 on
social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi
Arabia's economic development.

Transnational Issues ::Saudi Arabia




Disputes - international:


Saudi Arabia has reinforced its concrete-filled security barrier
along sections of the now fully demarcated border with Yemen to stem
illegal cross-border activities; Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continue
discussions on a maritime boundary with Iran; Saudi Arabia claims
Egyptian-administered islands of Tiran and Sanafir



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 240,015 (Palestinian Territories)
(2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Saudi Arabia is a destination country for workers
from South and Southeast Asia who are subjected to conditions that
constitute involuntary servitude including being subjected to
physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, confinement, and
withholding of passports as a restriction on their movement;
domestic workers are particularly vulnerable because some are
confined to the house in which they work unable to seek help; Saudi
Arabia is also a destination country for Nigerian, Yemeni,
Pakistani, Afghan, Somali, Malian, and Sudanese children trafficked
for forced begging and involuntary servitude as street vendors; some
Nigerian women were reportedly trafficked into Saudi Arabia for
commercial sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 3 - Saudi Arabia does not fully comply with the
minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
making significant efforts to do so; the government continues to
lack adequate anti-trafficking laws and, despite evidence of
widespread trafficking abuses, did not report any criminal
prosecutions, convictions, or prison sentences for trafficking
crimes committed against foreign domestic workers (2008)



Illicit drugs:


death penalty for traffickers; improving anti-money-laundering
legislation and enforcement
