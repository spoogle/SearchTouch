New Zealand  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::New Zealand




Background:


The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D. 800. In 1840,
their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain, the Treaty of
Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen Victoria while
retaining territorial rights. In that same year, the British began
the first organized colonial settlement. A series of land wars
between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native peoples.
The British colony of New Zealand became an independent dominion in
1907 and supported the UK militarily in both World Wars. New
Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances lapsed
by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to address
longstanding Maori grievances.

Economy ::New Zealand




Economy - overview:


Over the past 20 years the government has transformed New Zealand
from an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary British market
access to a more industrialized, free market economy that can
compete globally. This dynamic growth has boosted real incomes - but
left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and broadened and
deepened the technological capabilities of the industrial sector.
Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years until 2007 in
purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09. Debt-driven
consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half of the
decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that posed
a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures caused the
central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January 2004 until
it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08; international
capital inflows attracted to the high rates further strengthened the
currency and housing market, however, aggravating the current
account deficit. The economy fell into recession before the start of
the global financial crisis and contracted for five consecutive
quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the central bank cut
interest rates aggressively and the government developed fiscal
stimulus measures. The economy posted a 1.7% decline in 2009, but
pulled out of recession late in the year, and achieved 2.1% growth
in 2010. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain vulnerable to weak
external demand. The government plans to raise productivity growth
and develop infrastructure, while reining in government spending.
