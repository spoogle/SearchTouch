Field Listing :: Environment - current issues

  This entry lists the most pressing and important environmental
  problems. The following terms and abbreviations are used throughout
  the entry:
  Acidification - the lowering of soil and water pH due to acid
  precipitation and deposition usually through precipitation; this
  process disrupts ecosystem nutrient flows and may kill freshwater
  fish and plants dependent on more neutral or alkaline conditions
  (see acid rain).
  Acid rain - characterized as containing harmful levels of sulfur
  dioxide or nitrogen oxide; acid rain is damaging and potentially
  deadly to the earth's fragile ecosystems; acidity is measured using
  the pH scale where 7 is neutral, values greater than 7 are
  considered alkaline, and values below 5.6 are considered acid
  precipitation; note - a pH of 2.4 (the acidity of vinegar) has been
  measured in rainfall in New England.
  Aerosol - a collection of airborne particles dispersed in a gas,
  smoke, or fog.
  Afforestation - converting a bare or agricultural space by planting
  trees and plants; reforestation involves replanting trees on areas
  that have been cut or destroyed by fire.
  Asbestos - a naturally occurring soft fibrous mineral commonly used
  in fireproofing materials and considered to be highly carcinogenic
  in particulate form.
  Biodiversity - also biological diversity; the relative number of
  species, diverse in form and function, at the genetic, organism,
  community, and ecosystem level; loss of biodiversity reduces an
  ecosystem's ability to recover from natural or man-induced
  disruption.
  Bio-indicators - a plant or animal species whose presence,
  abundance, and health reveal the general condition of its habitat.
  Biomass - the total weight or volume of living matter in a given
  area or volume.
  Carbon cycle - the term used to describe the exchange of carbon (in
  various forms, e.g., as carbon dioxide) between the atmosphere,
  ocean, terrestrial biosphere, and geological deposits.
  Catchments - assemblages used to capture and retain rainwater and
  runoff; an important water management technique in areas with
  limited freshwater resources, such as Gibraltar.
  DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) - a colorless, odorless
  insecticide that has toxic effects on most animals; the use of DDT
  was banned in the US in 1972.
  Defoliants - chemicals which cause plants to lose their leaves
  artificially; often used in agricultural practices for weed control,
  and may have detrimental impacts on human and ecosystem health.
  Deforestation - the destruction of vast areas of forest (e.g.,
  unsustainable forestry practices, agricultural and range land
  clearing, and the over exploitation of wood products for use as
  fuel) without planting new growth.
  Desertification - the spread of desert-like conditions in arid or
  semi-arid areas, due to overgrazing, loss of agriculturally
  productive soils, or climate change.
  Dredging - the practice of deepening an existing waterway; also, a
  technique used for collecting bottom-dwelling marine organisms
  (e.g., shellfish) or harvesting coral, often causing significant
  destruction of reef and ocean-floor ecosystems.
  Drift-net fishing - done with a net, miles in extent, that is
  generally anchored to a boat and left to float with the tide; often
  results in an over harvesting and waste of large populations of
  non-commercial marine species (by-catch) by its effect of "sweeping
  the ocean clean."
  Ecosystems - ecological units comprised of complex communities of
  organisms and their specific environments.
  Effluents - waste materials, such as smoke, sewage, or industrial
  waste which are released into the environment, subsequently
  polluting it.
  Endangered species - a species that is threatened with extinction
  either by direct hunting or habitat destruction.
  Freshwater - water with very low soluble mineral content; sources
  include lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, and underground aquifers.
  Greenhouse gas - a gas that "traps" infrared radiation in the lower
  atmosphere causing surface warming; water vapor, carbon dioxide,
  nitrous oxide, methane, hydrofluorocarbons, and ozone are the
  primary greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere.
  Groundwater - water sources found below the surface of the earth
  often in naturally occurring reservoirs in permeable rock strata;
  the source for wells and natural springs.
  Highlands Water Project - a series of dams constructed jointly by
  Lesotho and South Africa to redirect Lesotho's abundant water supply
  into a rapidly growing area in South Africa; while it is the largest
  infrastructure project in southern Africa, it is also the most
  costly and controversial; objections to the project include claims
  that it forces people from their homes, submerges farmlands, and
  squanders economic resources.
  Inuit Circumpolar Conference (ICC) - represents the roughly 150,000
  Inuits of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia in international
  environmental issues; a General Assembly convenes every three years
  to determine the focus of the ICC; the most current concerns are
  long-range transport of pollutants, sustainable development, and
  climate change.
  Metallurgical plants - industries which specialize in the science,
  technology, and processing of metals; these plants produce highly
  concentrated and toxic wastes which can contribute to pollution of
  ground water and air when not properly disposed.
  Noxious substances - injurious, very harmful to living beings.
  Overgrazing - the grazing of animals on plant material faster than
  it can naturally regrow leading to the permanent loss of plant
  cover, a common effect of too many animals grazing limited range
  land.
  Ozone shield - a layer of the atmosphere composed of ozone gas (O3)
  that resides approximately 25 miles above the Earth's surface and
  absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation that can be harmful to living
  organisms.
  Poaching - the illegal killing of animals or fish, a great concern
  with respect to endangered or threatened species.
  Pollution - the contamination of a healthy environment by man-made
  waste.
  Potable water - water that is drinkable, safe to be consumed.
  Salination - the process through which fresh (drinkable) water
  becomes salt (undrinkable) water; hence, desalination is the reverse
  process; also involves the accumulation of salts in topsoil caused
  by evaporation of excessive irrigation water, a process that can
  eventually render soil incapable of supporting crops.
  Siltation - occurs when water channels and reservoirs become clotted
  with silt and mud, a side effect of deforestation and soil erosion.
  Slash-and-burn agriculture - a rotating cultivation technique in
  which trees are cut down and burned in order to clear land for
  temporary agriculture; the land is used until its productivity
  declines at which point a new plot is selected and the process
  repeats; this practice is sustainable while population levels are
  low and time is permitted for regrowth of natural vegetation;
  conversely, where these conditions do not exist, the practice can
  have disastrous consequences for the environment.
  Soil degradation - damage to the land's productive capacity because
  of poor agricultural practices such as the excessive use of
  pesticides or fertilizers, soil compaction from heavy equipment, or
  erosion of topsoil, eventually resulting in reduced ability to
  produce agricultural products.
  Soil erosion - the removal of soil by the action of water or wind,
  compounded by poor agricultural practices, deforestation,
  overgrazing, and desertification.
  Ultraviolet (UV) radiation - a portion of the electromagnetic energy
  emitted by the sun and naturally filtered in the upper atmosphere by
  the ozone layer; UV radiation can be harmful to living organisms and
  has been linked to increasing rates of skin cancer in humans.
  Waterborne diseases - those in which bacteria survive in, and are
  transmitted through, water; always a serious threat in areas with an
  untreated water supply.
