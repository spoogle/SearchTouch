Armenia  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Armenia




Background:


Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt
Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over
the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires
including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During
World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey
instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh
practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths.
The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in
1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was
conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan
began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after
both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces
held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of
Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by
their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful
resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1994
because of the Armenian separatists' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and
surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In
2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with
Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border; this process is
currently dormant.

Economy ::Armenia




Economy - overview:


After several years of double-digit economic growth, Armenia faced a
severe economic recession with GDP declining more than 14% in 2009,
despite large loans from multilateral institutions. Sharp declines
in the construction sector and workers' remittances, particularly
from Russia, were the main reasons for the downturn. The economy
began to recover in 2010 with nearly 5% growth. Under the old Soviet
central planning system, Armenia developed a modern industrial
sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other manufactured
goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw materials and energy.
Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from
the large agroindustrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has
managed to reduce poverty, slash inflation, stabilize its currency,
and privatize most small- and medium-sized enterprises. Since the
breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia had made progress in
implementing some economic reforms, including privatization, price
reforms, and prudent fiscal policies, but geographic isolation, a
narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business
sectors have made Armenia particularly vulnerable to the sharp
deterioration in the global economy and the economic downturn in
Russia. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic
Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to a
severe economic decline in the early 1990s and Armenia's borders
with Turkey remain closed until 2010, when Turkey and Armenia signed
an accord to reestablish diplomatic relations. Armenia is
particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental
support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or
managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity
distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's
RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas
from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas
deliveries are slated to expand due to the April 2010 completion of
the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia has some mineral deposits
(copper, gold, bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other
nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's
severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international
aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct
investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government
made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent
years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the
current economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and
forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the
IMF, and other international financial institutions. Armenia will
need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to regain
economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment
opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of
its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Telephone system:


general assessment: telecommunications investments have made major

are available across Yerevan in major cities and towns; significant
but ever-shrinking gaps remain in mobile-cellular coverage in rural
areas

international: country code - 374; Yerevan is connected to the
