Sweden  (Europe)

Introduction ::Sweden




Background:


A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not
participated in any war for almost two centuries. An armed
neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's
long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded
with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by
high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic
downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has
allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the
EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in
a 2003 referendum.

Economy ::Sweden




Economy - overview:


Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th century,
Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a mixed
system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It
has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
communications, and a skilled labor force. In September 2003,
Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned
about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower,
and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily
oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for
little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was
in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased
domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered
the center-right government considerable scope to implement its
reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare
dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy.
Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish
economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth
continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions
reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities
and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the
strong rebound in 2010.
