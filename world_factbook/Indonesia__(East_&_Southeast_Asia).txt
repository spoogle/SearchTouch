Indonesia  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Indonesia




Background:


The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th century;
Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its
independence after Japan's surrender, but it required four years of
intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and UN mediation
before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. Free
and fair legislative elections took place in 1999 after decades of
repressive rule. Indonesia is now the world's third most populous
democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state, and home to the
world's largest Muslim population. Current issues include:
alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing terrorism,
consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism,
implementing economic and financial reforms, stemming corruption,
holding the military and police accountable for human rights
violations, addressing climate change, and controlling avian
influenza. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement
with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic elections in
Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low intensity
armed resistance by the separatist Free Papua Movement.

Economy ::Indonesia




Economy - overview:


Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has weathered the global
financial crisis relatively smoothly because of its heavy reliance
on domestic consumption as the driver of economic growth. Although
the economy slowed significantly in 2009 from the 6%-plus growth
rate recorded in 2007 and 2008, by 2010 growth returned to a 6%
rate. During the recession, Indonesia outperformed its regional
neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting
growth. The government made economic advances under the first
administration of President YUDHOYONO, introducing significant
reforms in the financial sector, including tax and customs reforms,
the use of Treasury bills, and capital market development and
supervision. Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has
declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and
sound fiscal stewardship. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and
unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex
regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among
regions. YUDHOYONO's reelection, with respected economist BOEDIONO
as his vice president, suggests broad continuity of economic policy,
although the start of their term has been marred by corruption
scandals and the departure of an internationally respected finance
minister. The government in 2010 faces the ongoing challenge of
improving Indonesia's insufficient infrastructure to remove
impediments to economic growth, while addressing climate change
mitigation and adaptation needs, particularly with regard to
conserving Indonesia's forests and peatlands, the focus of a
potentially trailblazing $1 billion REDD+ pilot project.

refugees from Timor-Leste who left in 2003 still reside in Indonesia
and refuse repatriation; a 1997 treaty between Indonesia and
Australia settled some parts of their maritime boundary but
outstanding issues remain; ICJ's award of Sipadan and Ligitan
islands to Malaysia in 2002 left the sovereignty of Unarang rock and
the maritime boundary in the Ambalat oil block in the Celebes Sea in
dispute; the ICJ decision has prompted Indonesia to assert claims to
and to establish a presence on its smaller outer islands; Indonesia
and Singapore continue to work on finalization of their 1973
maritime boundary agreement by defining unresolved areas north of
Indonesia's Batam Island; Indonesian secessionists, squatters, and
illegal migrants create repatriation problems for Papua New Guinea;
maritime delimitation talks continue with Palau; Indonesian groups
