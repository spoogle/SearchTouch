  Geographic overview

World
  The surface of the earth is approximately 70.9% water and
  29.1% land. The former portion is divided into large water bodies
  termed oceans. The World Factbook recognizes and describes five
  oceans, which are in decreasing order of size: the Pacific Ocean,
  Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean.
  The land portion is generally divided into several, large, discrete
  landmasses termed continents. Depending on the convention used, the
  number of continents can vary from five to seven. The most common
  classification recognizes seven, which are (from largest to
  smallest): Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica,
  Europe, and Australia. Asia and Europe are sometimes lumped together
  into a Eurasian continent resulting in six continents.
  Alternatively, North and South America are sometimes grouped as
  simply the Americas, resulting in a continent total of six (or five,
  if the Eurasia designation is used).
  North America is commonly understood to include the island of
  Greenland, the isles of the Caribbean, and to extend south all the
  way to the Isthmus of Panama. The easternmost extent of Europe is
  generally defined as being the Ural Mountains and the Ural River; on
  the southeast the Caspian Sea; and on the south the Caucasus
  Mountains, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean. Portions of
  Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Turkey fall within both
  Europe and Asia, but in every instance the larger section is in
  Asia. These countries are considered part of both continents.
  Armenia and Cyprus, which lie completely in Western Asia, are
  geopolitically European countries.
  Asia usually incorporates all the islands of the Philippines,
  Malaysia, and Indonesia. The islands of the Pacific are often lumped
  with Australia into a "land mass" termed Oceania or Australasia.
  Africa's northeast extremity is frequently delimited at the Isthmus
  of Suez, but for geopolitical purposes, the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula
  is often included as part of Africa.
  Although the above groupings are the most common, different
  continental dispositions are recognized or taught in certain parts
  of the world, with some arrangements more heavily based on cultural
  spheres rather than physical geographic considerations.
