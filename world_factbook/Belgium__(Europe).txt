Belgium  (Europe)

Introduction ::Belgium




Background:


Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was
occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
and autonomy.

Economy ::Belgium




Economy - overview:


This modern, private-enterprise economy has capitalized on its
central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With few natural
resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw materials
and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its economy
vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Roughly three-quarters of
Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. In 2009 Belgian GDP
contracted by 2.7%, the unemployment rate rose slightly, and the
budget deficit worsened because of large-scale bail-outs in the
financial sector. Belgium's budget deficit widened to 4.8% of GDP in
2010, while public debt was just over 100% of GDP. Belgian banks
have been severely affected by the international financial crisis
with three major banks receiving capital injections from the
government. An ageing population and rising social expenditures are
also increasing pressure on public finances, making it likely the
government will need to implement unpopular austerity measures to
assuage investor concerns about Belgium's ability to restore fiscal
balance.
