Macau  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Macau




Background:


Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the first
European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement signed
by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the Macau
Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of
China on 20 December 1999. In this agreement, China promised that,
under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's socialist
economic system would not be practiced in Macau, and that Macau
would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign
and defense affairs for the next 50 years.

Economy ::Macau




Economy - overview:


Macau's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the
global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010, largely
on the back of strong tourism and gaming sectors. After opening up
its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in
2001, the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign
investment, transforming Macau into one of the world's largest
gaming center. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by
China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens
wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau's gaming revenue surpassed
that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for
more than 70% of total government revenue. In 2008, Macau introduced
measures to cool the rapidly developing sector. This city of nearly
570,000 hosted more than 21 million visitors in 2009. Almost 51%
came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry
has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber
Agreement in 2005. In 2009, total exports were less than US$1
billion, while gaming receipts were almost US$15 billion. By October
2010, gross gaming revenue had already reached US$19 billion for the
year. The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening
of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations
in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy. The
Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Macau and
mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers
Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland;
nevertheless, China remains Macau's third largest goods export
market, behind Hong Kong and the United States. Macau's currency,
the Pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also
freely accepted in the territory.
