Congo, Republic of the  (Africa)

Introduction ::Congo, Republic of the




Background:


Upon independence in 1960, the former French region of Middle Congo
became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter century of
experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a
democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil
war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO,
and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest.
Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March
2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a
humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's
largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will
need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the
long term.

Economy ::Congo, Republic of the




Economy - overview:


The economy is a mixture of subsistence agriculture, an industrial
sector based largely on oil and support services, and government
spending. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing a major share of government revenues and exports.
In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil revenues enabled the
government to finance large-scale development projects with GDP
growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest rates in Africa.
Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing, the government
has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil earnings through
oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing debt burden and
chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts have been
undertaken with the support of international organizations, notably
the World Bank and the IMF. However, the reform program came to a
halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted. Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who
returned to power when the war ended in October 1997, publicly
expressed interest in moving forward on economic reforms and
privatization and in renewing cooperation with international
financial institutions. Economic progress was badly hurt by slumping
oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in December 1998,
which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The current
administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and faces
difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and reducing
poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis reduced oil
revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil prices has
boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects. In March 2006,
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo,
receiving $1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010.

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Republic of the Congo is a source and destination
country for children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and
commercial sexual exploitation; girls are trafficked from rural
areas within the country for commercial sexual exploitation, forced
street vending, and domestic servitude; children are trafficked from
other African countries for domestic servitude, forced market
vending, and forced labor in the fishing industry

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Republic of the Congo is on the
Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to show evidence of increasing
efforts to combat trafficking in persons in 2007; struggling to
recover from six years of civil conflict that ended in 2003, the
Republic of the Congo's capacity to address trafficking is
handicapped; the government neither monitors its borders for
trafficking activity nor provides specialized anti-trafficking
training for law enforcement officials; the government does not
encourage victims to assist in trafficking investigations or
prosecutions, and has not taken measures to reduce demand for
commercial sex acts in the Republic of the Congo (2008)
