Lithuania  (Europe)

Introduction ::Lithuania




Background:


Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over the next
century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended its
territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By the
end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in Europe.
An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a union
through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and Poland
formally united into a single dual state, the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when its remnants were
partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania regained its
independence following World War I but was annexed by the USSR in
1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many other
countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the
Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not
recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the
abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993.
Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into
Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the
spring of 2004.

Economy ::Lithuania




Economy - overview:


Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade Organization and
joined the EU in May 2004. Despite Lithuania's EU accession,
Lithuania's trade with its Central and Eastern European neighbors,
and Russia in particular, accounts for a growing percentage of total
trade. Privatization of the large, state-owned utilities is nearly
complete. Foreign government and business support have helped in the
transition from the old command economy to a market economy.
Lithuania's economy grew on average 8% per year for the four years
prior to 2008 driven by exports and domestic demand. However, GDP
plunged nearly 15% in 2009 - during the 2008-09 crisis the three
former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's worst economic
declines. In 2009, the government launched a high-profile campaign,
led by Prime Minister KUBILIUS, to attract foreign investment and to
develop export markets. The current account deficit, which had risen
to roughly 15% of GDP in 2007-08, recovered to a surplus of 4% 2009
and 3.5% in 2010 in the wake of a cutback in imports to almost half
the 2008 level. Nevertheless, economic growth was flat and
unemployment continued upward to 16% in 2010.

Transnational Issues ::Lithuania




Disputes - international:


Lithuania and Russia committed to demarcating their boundary in 2006
in accordance with the land and maritime treaty ratified by Russia
in May 2003 and by Lithuania in 1999; Lithuania operates a
simplified transit regime for Russian nationals traveling from the
Kaliningrad coastal exclave into Russia, while still conforming, as
a EU member state having an external border with a non-EU member, to
strict Schengen border rules; the Latvian parliament has not
ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with Lithuania, primarily
due to concerns over potential hydrocarbons; as of January 2007,
ground demarcation of the boundary with Belarus was complete and
mapped with final ratification documents in preparation



Illicit drugs:


transshipment and destination point for cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy,
and opiates from Southwest Asia, Latin America, Western Europe, and
neighboring Baltic countries; growing production of high-quality
amphetamines, but limited production of cannabis, methamphetamines;
susceptible to money laundering despite changes to banking
legislation
