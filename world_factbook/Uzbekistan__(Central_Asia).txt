Uzbekistan  (Central Asia)

Introduction ::Uzbekistan




Background:


Russia conquered the territory of present-day Uzbekistan in the late
19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the Boshevik
Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist republic
established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive production of
"white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of agrochemicals and
the depletion of water supplies, which have left the land poisoned
and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry. Independent since
1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its dependence on
agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum reserves.
Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants, economic
stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and democratization.

Area:


total: 447,400 sq km
country comparison to the world: 56
land: 425,400 sq km

water: 22,000 sq km



Area - comparative:


slightly larger than California



Land boundaries:


total: 6,221 km

0 km (doubly landlocked); note - Uzbekistan includes the southern
portion of the Aral Sea with a 420 km shoreline



Maritime claims:


none (doubly landlocked)



Climate:


mostly midlatitude desert, long, hot summers, mild winters; semiarid
grassland in east



Terrain:


mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad, flat
intensely irrigated river valleys along course of Amu Darya, Syr
Darya (Sirdaryo), and Zarafshon; Fergana Valley in east surrounded
by mountainous Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; shrinking Aral Sea in west

Environment - current issues:


shrinkage of the Aral Sea is resulting in growing concentrations of
chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then
blown from the increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to
desertification; water pollution from industrial wastes and the
heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides is the cause of many human
health disorders; increasing soil salination; soil contamination
from buried nuclear processing and agricultural chemicals, including
DDT

Economy ::Uzbekistan




Economy - overview:


Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country; 11% of the land is
intensely cultivated, in irrigated river valleys. More than 60% of
the population lives in densely populated rural communities. Export
of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum, provided about
40% of foreign exchange earnings in 2009. Other major export earners
include gold and cotton. Uzbekistan is now the world's
second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer; it has
come under increasing international criticism for the use of child
labor in its annual cotton harvest. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan enjoyed
a bumper cotton crop in 2010 amidst record high prices. Following
independence in September 1991, the government sought to prop up its
Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls on
production and prices. While aware of the need to improve the
investment climate, the government still sponsors measures that
often increase, not decrease, its control over business decisions. A
sharp increase in the inequality of income distribution has hurt the
lower ranks of society since independence. In 2003, the government
accepted Article VIII obligations under the IMF, providing for full
currency convertibility. However, strict currency controls and
tightening of borders have lessened the effects of convertibility
and have also led to some shortages that have further stifled
economic activity. The Central Bank often delays or restricts
convertibility, especially for consumer goods. Potential investment
by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil industry, as well as
increased cooperation with South Korea in the realm of civil
aviation, may boost growth prospects. However, decreased demand for
natural gas in Europe and Russia in the wake of the global financial
crisis could reduce energy-related revenues in the near term. In
November 2005, Russian President Vladimir PUTIN and Uzbekistan
President KARIMOV signed an "alliance," which included provisions
for economic and business cooperation. Russian businesses have shown
increased interest in Uzbekistan, especially in mining, telecom, and
oil and gas. In 2006, Uzbekistan took steps to rejoin the Collective
Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the Eurasian Economic
Community (EurASEC), which it subsequently left in 2008, both
organizations dominated by Russia. In the past Uzbek authorities had
accused US and other foreign companies operating in Uzbekistan of
violating Uzbek tax laws and have frozen their assets, but no new
expropriations occurred in 2008-09. Instead, the Uzbek Government
has actively courted several major U.S. and international
corporations, offering attractive financing and tax advantages, and
has landed a significant US investment in the automotive industry.
Although growth slowed in 2009-10, Uzbekistan has seen few other
effects from the global economic downturn, primarily due to its
relative isolation from the global financial markets.

labor in the agricultural and construction industries, and for
commercial sexual exploitation

List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat severe forms of trafficking in 2007; the government did not
amend its criminal code to increase penalties for convicted
traffickers; in March 2008, Uzbekistan adopted ILO Conventions on
minimum age of employment and on the elimination of the worst forms
of child labor and is working with the ILO on implementation; the
government also demonstrated its increasing commitment to combat
trafficking in March 2008 by adopting a comprehensive
anti-trafficking law; Uzbekistan has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
Protocol (2008)
