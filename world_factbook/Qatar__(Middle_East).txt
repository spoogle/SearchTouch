Qatar  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Qatar




Background:


Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar transformed
itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for pearling
into an independent state with significant oil and natural gas
revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari economy
was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum revenues by
the Amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son, the current
Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew him in a bloodless coup
in 1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding border disputes
with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil and natural gas
revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the second-highest per capita
income in the world.

Economy ::Qatar




Economy - overview:


Despite the global financial crisis, Qatar has prospered in the last
several years - in 2010 Qatar had the world's highest growth rate.
Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to protect the local
banking sector with direct investments into domestic banks. GDP
rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in oil prices.
Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's nonassociated
natural gas reserves and increasing private and foreign investment
in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still account for more than
50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings, and 70% of government
revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the second highest per-capita
income country - following Liechtenstein - and likely the country
with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil reserves of 15 billion
barrels should enable continued output at current levels for 37
years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas exceed 25 trillion
cubic meters, about 14% of the world total and third largest in the
world. Qatar's successful 2022 world cup bid will likely accelerate
large-scale infrastructure projects such as Qatar's metro system and
the Qatar-Bahrain causeway.

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Qatar is a destination country for men and women
from South and Southeast Asia who migrate willingly, but are
subsequently trafficked into involuntary servitude as domestic
workers and laborers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual
exploitation; the most common offense was forcing workers to accept
worse contract terms than those under which they were recruited;
other conditions include bonded labor, withholding of pay,
restrictions on movement, arbitrary detention, and physical, mental,
and sexual abuse

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Qatar does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in
February 2009, Qatar enacted a new migrant worker sponsorship law
that criminalizes some practices commonly used by trafficking
offenders, and it announced plans to use that law effectively to
prevent human trafficking; punishment for offenses related to
trafficking in persons remains lower than that for crimes such as
rape and kidnapping, and the Qatari government has yet to take
significant action to investigate, prosecute, and punish trafficking
offenses; the government continues to lack formal victim
identification procedures and, as a result, victims of trafficking
are likely punished for acts committed as a direct result of being
trafficked (2009)
