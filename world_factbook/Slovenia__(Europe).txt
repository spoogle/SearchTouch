Slovenia  (Europe)

Introduction ::Slovenia




Background:


The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the
latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918, the
Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new multinational
state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World War II,
Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which though
Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied with
the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes succeeded
in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short 10-day war.
Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable
democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern
state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of
2004; it joined the eurozone in 2007.

Economy ::Slovenia




Economy - overview:


Slovenia became the first 2004 European Union entrant to adopt the
euro (on 1 January 2007) and has become a model of economic success
and stability for the region. With the highest per capita GDP in
Central Europe, Slovenia has excellent infrastructure, a
well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the
Balkans and Western Europe. Privatization has lagged since 2002, and
the economy has one of highest levels of state control in the EU.
Structural reforms to improve the business environment have allowed
for somewhat greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and
have helped to lower unemployment. In March 2004, Slovenia became
the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to
donor partner at the World Bank. In December 2007, Slovenia was
invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite
its economic success, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia
has lagged behind the region average, and taxes remain relatively
high. Furthermore, the labor market is often seen as inflexible, and
legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in
China, India, and elsewhere. In 2009, the world recession caused the
economy to contract - through falling exports and industrial
production - by more than 8%, and unemployment to rise above 9%.
Although growth resumed in 2010, the unemployment rate continued to
rise, topping 10%.
