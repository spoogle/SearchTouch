Cyprus  (Europe)

Introduction ::Cyprus




Background:


A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960 following
years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the Greek
Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head in
December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia.
Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic
intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into
enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek
Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by
military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a
third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area
declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"),
but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot
president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both
the Turkish and Cypriot Governments to reopen unification
negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the Greek Cypriot
and Turkish Cypriot communities started negotiations under UN
auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The entire island
entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of
common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the
internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas
administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish
Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus
citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens
of European Union states.

note: a separation of the two ethnic communities inhabiting the
island began following the outbreak of communal strife in 1963; this
separation was further solidified after the Turkish intervention in
July 1974 that followed a Greek military-junta-supported coup
attempt that gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the
north; Greek Cypriots control the only internationally recognized
government; on 15 November 1983 Turkish Cypriot "President" Rauf
DENKTASH declared independence and the formation of a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"), which is recognized only by
Turkey

Turkish intervention, Turkish Cypriots created their own
constitution and governing bodies within the "Turkish Federated
State of Cyprus," which became the "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus (TRNC)" when the Turkish Cypriots declared independence in

Economy ::Cyprus




Economy - overview:


The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control has a
market economy dominated by the service sector, which accounts for
nearly four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, financial services, and real
estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the
past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which often
fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic
conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area
under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU
average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national
currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the
preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a
soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in
2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under
pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of
reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial
crisis. Although Cyprus lagged its EU peers in showing signs of
stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in
mid 2009 and contracted 1.8% for the year. In addition, the budget
deficit is on the rise and reached 5.7% of GDP in 2010, a violation
of the EU's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP. In
response to the country's deteriorating finances, Nicosia is
promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state
payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits. However, it
has been slow to act, lacking a consensus in parliament and among
the social partners for its proposed measures.

Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots:


Economy - overview: The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly half the
per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth tends to be
volatile, given the north's relative isolation, bloated public
sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small market size.
Agriculture and services, together, employ more than half of the
work force. The Turkish Cypriot economy grew around 10.6% in 2006,
fueled by growth in the construction and education sectors, as well
as increased employment of Turkish Cypriots in the area under
government control. GDP declined about 2.0% in 2007. The Turkish
Cypriots are heavily dependent on transfers from the Turkish
Government. Ankara directly finances about one-third of the "TRNC's"
budget. Aid from Turkey has exceeded $400 million annually in recent
years. The Turkish Cypriot economy experienced a sharp slowdown in
2008-09 due to the global financial crisis and, because of its
reliance on British and Turkish tourism, which has declined due to
the recession. Turkish Cypriot finances also deteriorated in 2009 as
decreased state revenues and increased government expenditures on
public sector salaries and social services led to a large budget
deficit. As tourism and the world economy picked up, the economy
grew about 0.6% in 2010.
