Vietnam  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Vietnam




Background:


The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was completed by
1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887. Vietnam declared
independence after World War II, but France continued to rule until
its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho Chi MINH. Under the
Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into the Communist North
and anti-Communist South. US economic and military aid to South
Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt to bolster the
government, but US armed forces were withdrawn following a
cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North Vietnamese
forces overran the South reuniting the country under Communist rule.
Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the country
experienced little economic growth because of conservative
leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals
- many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing
international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's
"doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have
committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted
structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce
more competitive, export-driven industries. The Communist leaders,
however, maintain control on political expression and have resisted
outside calls to improve human rights. The country continues to
experience small-scale protests from various groups, the vast
majority connected to land-use issues, calls for increased political
space and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes.
Various ethnic minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central
Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also
held protests.

Economy ::Vietnam




Economy - overview:


Vietnam is a densely-populated developing country that in the last
30 years has had to recover from the ravages of war, the loss of
financial support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the rigidities of a
centrally-planned economy. Vietnamese authorities have reaffirmed
their commitment to economic liberalization and international
integration. They have moved to implement the structural reforms
needed to modernize the economy and to produce more competitive
export-driven industries. Vietnam joined the WTO in January 2007
following more than a decade-long negotiation process. WTO
membership has provided Vietnam an anchor to the global market and
reinforced the domestic economic reform process. Agriculture's share
of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in 2000 to
about 21% in 2009. Deep poverty has declined significantly and
Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a labor
force that is growing by more than one million people every year.
The global recession has hurt Vietnam's export-oriented economy with
GDP growing less than the 7% per annum average achieved during the
last decade. In 2009 exports fell nearly 10% year-on-year, prompting
the government to consider adjustments to tariffs to limit the trade
deficit. The government has used stimulus spending, including a
subsidized lending program, to help the economy through the global
financial crisis. Vietnam's managed currency, the dong, faced
downward pressure during the recession and the government devalued
it by nearly 7% in December 2009. Foreign donors pledged $8 billion
in new development assistance for 2010. Export growth resumed in
2010, driving GDP upward. However, Hanoi has struggled to control
one of the region's highest inflation rates, which stands at 11.1%
with interest hikes and multiple devaluations of the dong. Vietnam's
economy faces higher lending rates, additional IMF scrutiny,
domestic inflationary pressures, and an underperforming stock market.
