Introduction ::Kenya




Background:


Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA led
Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when
President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional
succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969
until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made
itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and
external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The
ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power
in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and
fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the
Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following
fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate
of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow
Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed
the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption
platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over the
constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU
to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement,
which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular
referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007
brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and
unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people
died. UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing
accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position
of prime minister.

Economy ::Kenya




Economy - overview:


Although the regional hub for trade and finance in East Africa,
Kenya has been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon several
primary goods whose prices have remained low. In 1997, the IMF
suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to the
government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption. The
IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through a
drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to
institute several anticorruption measures. In the key December 2002
elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new
opposition government took on the formidable economic problems
facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out
corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was
rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the
World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on
corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have
since resumed lending, despite little action on the government's
part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008,
coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on
remittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008, but the
economy rebounded in 2009-10.

Transnational Issues ::Kenya




Disputes - international:


Kenya served as an important mediator in brokering Sudan's
north-south separation in February 2005; Kenya provides shelter to
almost a quarter of a million refugees, including Ugandans who flee
across the border periodically to seek protection from Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA) rebels; Kenya works hard to prevent the clan
and militia fighting in Somalia from spreading across the border,
which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists; the boundary that
separates Kenya's and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi
Triangle," which Kenya has administered since colonial times

refugees (country of origin): 173,702 (Somalia); 73,004 (Sudan);

IDPs: 250,000-400,000 (2007 post-election violence; KANU attacks on
opposition tribal groups in 1990s) (2007)



Illicit drugs:


widespread harvesting of small plots of marijuana; transit country
for South Asian heroin destined for Europe and North America; Indian
methaqualone also transits on way to South Africa; significant
potential for money-laundering activity given the country's status
as a regional financial center; massive corruption, and relatively
high levels of narcotics-associated activities
