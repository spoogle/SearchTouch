Brunei  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Brunei




Background:


The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th and 17th
centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest
Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently entered a
period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In
1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was
achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six
centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas
fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in Asia.

Economy ::Brunei




Economy - overview:


Brunei has a small well-to-do economy that encompasses a mixture of
foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government regulation,
welfare measures, and village tradition. Crude oil and natural gas
production account for just over half of GDP and more than 90% of
exports. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia, and
substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from
domestic production. The government provides for all medical
services and free education through the university level and
subsidizes rice and housing. A new monetary authority was
established in January 2011 with responsibilities that include
monetary policy, monitoring of financial institutions, and currency
trading activities. Other plans for the future include upgrading the
labor force, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and
tourist sectors, increasing agricultural production, and, in
general, further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.

Transnational Issues ::Brunei




Disputes - international:


Brunei and Malaysia agreed in September 2008 to resolve their
offshore and deepwater seabed dispute, resume hydrocarbon
exploration, and renounce any territorial claims along their land
boundary; despite no public territorial claim to Louisa Reef, Brunei
implicitly lays claim by including it within the natural
prolongation of its continental shelf and basis for a seabed median
with Vietnam; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the
South China Sea" has eased tensions in the Spratly Islands but falls
short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by several of
the disputants



Illicit drugs:


drug trafficking and illegally importing controlled substances are
serious offenses in Brunei and carry a mandatory death penalty
