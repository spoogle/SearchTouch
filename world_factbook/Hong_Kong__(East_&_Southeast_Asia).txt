Hong Kong  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Hong Kong




Background:


Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded by China
the following year; various adjacent lands were added later in the
19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and the UK on
19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on 1
July 1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under its "one
country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system
would not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a
high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense
affairs for the next 50 years.

Economy ::Hong Kong




Economy - overview:


Hong Kong has a free market economy highly dependent on
international trade and finance - the value of goods and services
trade, including the sizable share of re-exports, is about four
times GDP. Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global
economic slowdown, but its increasing integration with China,
through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it recover more
quickly than many observers anticipated. The Hong Kong government is
promoting the Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the site for
Chinese renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are
allowed to establish RMB-denominated savings accounts;
RMB-denominated corporate and Chinese government bonds have been
issued in Hong Kong; and RMB trade settlement is allowed. The
territory far exceeded the RMB conversion quota set by Beijing for
trade settlements in 2010 due to the growth of earnings from exports
to the mainland. RMB deposits grew to roughly 3.6% of total system
deposits in Hong Kong by October 2010, an increase of over 250%
since the beginning of the year. The government is pursuing efforts
to introduce additional use of RMB in Hong Kong financial markets
and is seeking to expand the RMB quota for 2011. The mainland has
long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner, accounting for about
half of Hong Kong's exports by value. Hong Kong's natural resources
are limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. As a
result of China's easing of travel restrictions, the number of
mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5 million in
2001 to 17.7 million in 2009, outnumbering visitors from all other
countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the
premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In
2009 mainland Chinese companies constituted about 40% of the firms
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for 60% of the
Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong
Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service
industry has grown rapidly and in 2009 accounted for more than 90%
of the territory's GDP. GDP growth averaged a strong 4% from 1989 to
2008. Hong Kong's GDP fell in 2009 as a result of the global
financial crisis, but a recovery began in third quarter 2009, and
the economy grew nearly 6% in 2010. The Hong Kong government adopted
several temporary fiscal policy support measures in response to the
crisis that it may discontinue if strong growth is sustained. Credit
expansion and tight housing supply conditions caused Hong Kong
property prices to rise rapidly in 2010, and some lower income
segments of the population are increasingly unable to afford
adequate housing. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely
to the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.
