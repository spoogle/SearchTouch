Wallis and Futuna  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Wallis and Futuna




Background:


The Futuna island group was discovered by the Dutch in 1616 and
Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the French who declared a
protectorate over the islands in 1842. In 1959, the inhabitants of
the islands voted to become a French overseas territory.

mountainous terrain of Futuna is particularly prone to erosion;
there are no permanent settlements on Alofi because of the lack of
natural fresh water resources
