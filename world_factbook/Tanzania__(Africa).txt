Tanzania  (Africa)

Introduction ::Tanzania




Background:


Shortly after achieving independence from Britain in the early
1960s, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form the nation of Tanzania
in 1964. One-party rule came to an end in 1995 with the first
democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s. Zanzibar's
semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to two
contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won despite
international observers' claims of voting irregularities.

Economy ::Tanzania




Economy - overview:


Tanzania is one of the world's poorest economies in terms of per
capita income, however, Tanzania average 7% GDP growth per year
between 2000 and 2008 on strong gold production and tourism. The
economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts for more than
one-fourth of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about 60% of
the work force. The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors have
provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic
infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are
important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms
have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the
government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its
budget. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies
supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In
2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge
Compact grant, worth $698 million. Dar es Salaam used fiscal
stimulus and loosened monitary policy to ease the impact of the
global recession. GDP growth in 2009-10 was a respectable 6% per
year due to high gold prices and increased production.
