Malta  (Europe)

Introduction ::Malta




Background:


Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814. The
island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and
remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A
decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the
island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a
financial center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU
member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.

Flag description:


two equal vertical bands of white (hoist side) and red; in the upper
hoist-side corner is a representation of the George Cross, edged in
red; according to legend, the colors are taken from the red and
white checkered banner of Count Roger of Sicily who removed a
bi-colored corner and granted it to Malta in 1091; an uncontested
explanation is that the colors are those of the Knights of Saint
John who ruled Malta from 1530 to 1798; in 1942, King George VI of
the United Kingdom awarded the George Cross to the islanders for
their exceptional bravery and gallantry in World War II; since
independence in 1964, the George Cross bordered in red has appeared
directly on the white field

Economy ::Malta




Economy - overview:


Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited fresh
water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta's
geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for
illegal immigration, which has strained Malta's political and
economic resources. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.
Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in
2008-09 it escaped significant damage from the international
financial crisis, largely because the sector is centered on the
indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged. Locally,
the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed
to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent
risk-management practices. The global economic downturn and high
electricity and water prices hurt Malta's real economy, which is
dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing - especially electronics
and pharmaceuticals - and tourism, but growth bounced back as the
global economy recovered in 2010. Following a 1.2% contraction in
2009, GDP grew 2% in 2010.
