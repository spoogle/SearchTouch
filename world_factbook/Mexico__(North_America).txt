Mexico  (North America)

Introduction ::Mexico




Background:


The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came under
Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence early
in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994 threw
Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession in over
half a century. The global financial crisis beginning in late 2008
caused another massive economic downturn the following year. As the
economy recovers, ongoing economic and social concerns include low
real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the population,
inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities
for the largely Amerindian population in the impoverished southern
states. The elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the
1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX
of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in
government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was
succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON. In
January 2009, Mexico assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security
Council for the 2009-10 term.

central-southern part of the country; the volcanoes in Baja
California are mostly dormant; Colima (elev. 3,850 m, 12,631 ft),
which erupted in 2010, is Mexico's most active volcano and is
responsible for causing periodic evacuations of nearby villagers; it
has been deemed a "Decade Volcano" by the International Association
of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of
study due to its explosive history and close proximity to human
populations; Popocatepetl (elev. 5,426 m, 17,802 ft) poses a threat
to Mexico City; other historically active volcanoes include Barcena,
Ceboruco, El Chichon, Michoacan-Guanajuato, Pico de Orizaba, San

three equal vertical bands of green (hoist side), white, and red;
Mexico's coat of arms (an eagle with a snake in its beak perched on
a cactus) is centered in the white band; green signifies hope, joy,
and love; white represents peace and honesty; red stands for
hardiness, bravery, strength, and valor; the coat of arms is derived
from a legend that the wandering Aztec people were to settle at a
location where they would see an eagle on a catus eating a snake;
the city they founded, Tenochtitlan, is now Mexico City

note: similar to the flag of Italy, which is shorter, uses lighter
shades of red and green, and does not have anything in its white band

accomplished poet, was uninterested in submitting lyrics to a
national anthem contest; his fiancee locked him in a room and
refused to release him until the lyrics were completed







Economy ::Mexico




Economy - overview:


Mexico has a free market economy in the trillion dollar class. It
contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and agriculture,
increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent administrations
have expanded competition in seaports, railroads,
telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas
distribution, and airports. Per capita income is roughly one-third
that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Since
the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico's share of US imports has increased from 7%
to 12%, and its share of Canadian imports has doubled to 5%. Mexico
has free trade agreements with over 50 countries including,
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and
Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements.
In 2007, during its first year in office, the Felipe CALDERON
administration was able to garner support from the opposition to
successfully pass pension and fiscal reforms. The administration
passed an energy reform measure in 2008, and another fiscal reform
in 2009. Mexico's GDP plunged 6.5% in 2009 as world demand for
exports dropped and asset prices tumbled, but GDP posted positive
growth of 5% in 2010, with export growth leading the way. The
administration continues to face many economic challenges, including
improving the public education system, upgrading infrastructure,
modernizing labor laws, and fostering private investment in the
energy sector. CALDERON has stated that his top economic priorities
remain reducing poverty and creating jobs.
