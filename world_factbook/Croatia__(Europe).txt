Croatia  (Europe)

Introduction ::Croatia




Background:


The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the
Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as
Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal
independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.
Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before
occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under
UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was
returned to Croatia in 1998. In April 2009, Croatia joined NATO; it
is a candidate for eventual EU accession.

Economy ::Croatia




Economy - overview:


Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics, Croatia's
economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war as output collapsed
and the country missed the early waves of investment in Central and
Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. Between
2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve
slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6% led by
a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation
over the same period has remained tame and the currency, the kuna,
stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still remain, including a
stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing trade deficit and
uneven regional development. The state retains a large role in the
economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff public and
political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization has largely
been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep resistance on
the part of the public and lack of strong support from politicians.
The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and structural
reform. While long term growth prospects for the economy remain
strong, Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of the
global financial crisis. Croatia's high foreign debt, anemic export
sector, strained state budget, and over-reliance on tourism revenue
will result in higher risk to economic stability over the medium
term.
