Korea, South  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Korea, South




Background:


An independent Korean state or collection of states has existed
almost continuously for several millennia. Between its initial
unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor Korean
states - until the 20th century, Korea existed as a single
independent country. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War,
Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan, and in 1910 it was
annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following
Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II,
a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the
Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in
the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and
UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South
Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An
armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a
demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South
Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising
to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Young-sam
became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of
military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern
democracy. President LEE Myung-bak has pursued a policy of global
engagement since taking office in February 2008, highlighted by
Seoul's hosting of the G-20 summit in November 2010. Serious
tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in
recent years, including the North's sinking of the South Korean
warship Cheonan in March 2010 and its artillery attack on South
Korean soldiers and citizens in November 2010.

Economy ::Korea, South




Economy - overview:


Since the 1960s, South Korea has achieved an incredible record of
growth and global integration to become a high-tech industrialized
economy. Four decades ago, GDP per capita was comparable with levels
in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. In 2004, South Korea
joined the trillion dollar club of world economies, and currently is
among the world's 20 largest economies. Initially, a system of close
government and business ties, including directed credit and import
restrictions, made this success possible. The government promoted
the import of raw materials and technology at the expense of
consumer goods, and encouraged savings and investment over
consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 exposed
longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model including
high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign borrowing.
GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in 1999-2000.
Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the crisis,
including greater openness to foreign investment and imports. Growth
moderated to about 4-5% annually between 2003 and 2007. With the
global economic downturn in late 2008, South Korean GDP growth
slowed to 0.2% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the economy
began to recover, in large part due to export growth, low interest
rates, and an expansionary fiscal policy, and growth exceeded 6% in
2010. The South Korean economy's long term challenges include a
rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, and
overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth.
