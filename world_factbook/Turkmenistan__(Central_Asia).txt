Turkmenistan  (Central Asia)

Introduction ::Turkmenistan




Background:


Eastern Turkmenistan for centuries formed part of the Persian
province of Khurasan; in medieval times Merv (today known as Mary)
was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an important
stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia between 1865 and 1885,
Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic in 1924. It achieved
independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive
hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this
underdeveloped country once extraction and delivery projects are
expanded. The Turkmen Government is actively working to diversify
its gas export routes beyond the still dominant Russian pipeline
network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to
China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the
Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. President for Life
Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Turkmenistan held its
first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007.
Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW,
emerged as the country's new president.

Economy ::Turkmenistan




Economy - overview:


Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive agriculture
in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources. The two
largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for export, and
wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although agriculture accounts
for roughly 10% of GDP, it continues to employ nearly half of the
country's workforce. With an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in
power and a tribally based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken
a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton
export revenues to sustain its inefficient economy. Privatization
goals remain limited. From 1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the
continued lack of adequate export routes for natural gas and from
obligations on extensive short-term external debt. At the same time,
however, total exports rose by an average of roughly 15% per year
from 2003-08, largely because of higher international oil and gas
prices. New pipelines to China and Iran, that began operation in
late 2009 and early 2010, have given Turkmenistan additional export
routes for its gas, although these new routes have not offset the
sharp drop in export revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas
exports to Russia. Overall prospects in the near future are
discouraging because of widespread internal poverty, endemic
corruption, a poor educational system, government misuse of oil and
gas revenues, and Ashgabat's reluctance to adopt market-oriented
reforms. In the past, Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state
secrets. The new government has established a State Agency for
Statistics, but GDP numbers and other figures are subject to wide
margins of error. In particular, the rate of GDP growth is
uncertain. Since his election, President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the
country's dual currency exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of
the manat, reduced state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated
development of a special tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although
foreign investment is encouraged, numerous bureaucratic obstacles
impede international business activity.

Telephone system:


general assessment: telecommunications network remains
underdeveloped and progress toward improvement is slow; strict
government control and censorship inhibits liberalization and
modernization

domestic: Turkmentelekom, in cooperation with foreign partners, has
installed high speed fiber-optic lines and has upgraded most of the
country's telephone exchanges and switching centers with new digital
technology; mobile telephone usage is expanding with Russia's Mobile
Telesystems (MTS) the primary service provider; combined fixed-line
and mobile teledensity is about 40 per 100 persons

international: country code - 993; linked by fiber-optic cable and
microwave radio relay to other CIS republics and to other countries
by leased connections to the Moscow international gateway switch; an
exchange in Ashgabat switches international traffic through Turkey
via Intelsat; satellite earth stations - 1 Orbita and 1 Intelsat
(2008)



Broadcast media:


broadcast media is government controlled and censored; 4 state-owned
TV and 4 state-owned radio networks; satellite dishes and
programming provide an alternative to the state-run media; officials
sometimes limit access to satellite TV by seizing satellite dishes
