Greece  (Europe)

Introduction ::Greece




Background:


Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829. During
the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th
century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories,
most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was
first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany
(1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between
supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and Communist
rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in
1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power,
establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political
liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974,
democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary
republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC
(now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and
Monetary Union in 2001. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default on
its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and
raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily
leave the common currency or be removed.

Economy ::Greece




Economy - overview:


Greece has a capitalist economy with the public sector accounting
for about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP about two-thirds that
of the leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides 15% of GDP.
Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in
agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU
aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek economy grew by
nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007, due partly to
infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games,
and in part to an increased availability of credit, which has
sustained record levels of consumer spending. But the economy went
into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis,
tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a
growing budget deficit, which was triggered by falling state
revenues, and increased government expenditures. The economy
contracted by 2% in 2009, and 4.8% in 2010. Greece violated the EU's
Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than
3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006, but finally met that criterion in
2007-08, before exceeding it again in 2009, with the deficit
reaching 15.4% of GDP. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to
9.4% of GDP in 2010. Public debt, inflation, and unemployment are
above the euro-zone average while per capita income is below;
unemployment rose to 12% in 2010. Eroding public finances, a
credibility gap stemming from inaccurate and misreported statistics,
and consistent underperformance on following through with reforms
prompted major credit rating agencies in late 2009 to downgrade
Greece's international debt rating, and has led the country into a
financial crisis. Under intense pressure by the EU and international
market participants, the government has adopted a medium-term
austerity program that includes cutting government spending,
reducing the size of the public sector, decreasing tax evasion,
reforming the health care and pension systems, and improving
competitiveness through structural reforms to the labor and product
markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to push through
unpopular reforms in the face of often vocal opposition from the
country's powerful labor unions and the general public. Greek labor
unions are striking over new austerity measures, but the strikes so
far have had a limited impact on the government's will to adopt
reforms. An uptick in widespread unrest, however, could challenge
the government's ability to implement reforms and meet budget
targets, and could also lead to rioting or violence. In April 2010 a
leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit
rating; in May, the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone
governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans
worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to
creditors. In exchange for the largest bailout ever assembled, the
government announced combined spending cuts and tax increases
totaling $40 billion over three years, on top of the tough austerity
measures already taken. Greece, however, struggled to boost revenues
and cut spending to meet 2010 targets set by the EU and the IMF,
especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised
upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. Greece's
lenders are calling on Athens to step up efforts in 2011 to increase
tax collection, shore up public enterprises, and rein in health
spending, and are planning to give Greece more time to repay its
EU-IMF loan. Greece responded by introducing major structural
reforms, but investors still question whether Greece can sustain
fiscal efforts in the face of a bleak economic outlook and public
discontent.
