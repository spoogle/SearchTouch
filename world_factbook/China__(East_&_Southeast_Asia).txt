Introduction ::China




Background:


For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing the
rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and
early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major
famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War
II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic
socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed
strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of
millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and
other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by
2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living
standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal
choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. China
since the early 1990s has increased its global outreach and
participation in international organizations.

Economy ::China




Economy - overview:


China's economy since the late 1970s has changed from a closed,
centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that plays a
major role in the global economy - in 2010 China became the world's
largest exporter. Reforms began with the phasing out of
collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual
liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased
autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking
system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private
sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China generally
has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years,
China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors
it considers important to "economic security," explicitly looking to
foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its
currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005
China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved
to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies.
From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi
against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate
remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global
financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of
a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and
resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold
increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity
(PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood
as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having
surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural
and industrial output each exceeded those of the US, although China
was second to the US in the value of services it produced. Still,
per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government
faces numerous economic development challenges, including: (a)
reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low
domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of
millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c)
reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing
environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's
rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in
coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200
million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban
areas to find work. One demographic consequence of the "one child"
policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries
in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air
pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table,
especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China
continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy
production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing
on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global
economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the
first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming
all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The
economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011,
lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out
during the global financial crisis. The government vows to continue
reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic
consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports
for GDP growth in the future, but China likely will make only
marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two
economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late
in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local
government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and
is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.

GDP (official exchange rate):

note: because China's exchange rate is determine by fiat, rather
than by market forces, the official exchange rate measure of GDP is
not an accurate measure of China's output; GDP at the official
exchange rate substantially understates the actual level of China's
output vis-a-vis the rest of the world; in China's situation, GDP at
purchasing power parity provides the best measure for comparing
output across countries (2010 est.)

Telephone system:


general assessment: domestic and international services are
increasingly available for private use; unevenly distributed
domestic system serves principal cities, industrial centers, and
many towns; China continues to develop its telecommunications
infrastructure, and is partnering with foreign providers to expand
its global reach; China in the summer of 2008 began a major
restructuring of its telecommunications industry, resulting in the
consolidation of its six telecom service operators to three, China
Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom, each providing both
fixed-line and mobile services

domestic: interprovincial fiber-optic trunk lines and cellular
telephone systems have been installed; mobile-cellular
subscribership is increasing rapidly; the number of Internet users
exceeded 250 million by summer 2008; a domestic satellite system
with 55 earth stations is in place

international: country code - 86; a number of submarine cables
provide connectivity to Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and the US;
satellite earth stations - 7 (5 Intelsat - 4 Pacific Ocean and 1
Indian Ocean; 1 Intersputnik - Indian Ocean region; and 1 Inmarsat -
Pacific and Indian Ocean regions) (2008)



Broadcast media:


all broadcast media are owned by, or affiliated with, the Communist
Party of China or a government agency; no privately-owned television
or radio stations with state-run Chinese Central TV, provincial, and
municipal stations offering more than 2,000 channels; the Central
Propaganda Department lists subjects that are off limits to domestic
broadcast media with the government maintaining authority to approve
all programming; foreign-made TV programs must be approved prior to
broadcast (2008)

Transnational Issues ::China




Disputes - international:


continuing talks and confidence-building measures work toward
reducing tensions over Kashmir that nonetheless remains militarized
with portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai
Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and
Northern Areas); India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic
Kashmir lands to China in 1964; China and India continue their
security and foreign policy dialogue started in 2005 related to the
dispute over most of their rugged, militarized boundary, regional
nuclear proliferation, and other matters; China claims most of
India's Arunachal Pradesh to the base of the Himalayas; lacking any
treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and China continue
negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment to resolve
territorial disputes due to cartographic discrepancies; Chinese maps
show an international boundary symbol off the coasts of the littoral
states of the South China Seas, where China has interrupted
Vietnamese hydrocarbon exploration; China asserts sovereignty over
Scarborough Reef along with the Philippines and Taiwan, and over the
Spratly Islands together with Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan,
Vietnam, and Brunei; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties
in the South China Sea" eased tensions in the Spratly's but is not
the legally binding "code of conduct" sought by some parties;
Vietnam and China continue to expand construction of facilities in
the Spratly's and in March 2005, the national oil companies of
China, the Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord on marine
seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China occupies some of
the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; China and
Taiwan continue to reject both Japan's claims to the uninhabited
islands of Senkaku-shoto (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's unilaterally
declared equidistance line in the East China Sea, the site of
intensive hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation; certain islands
in the Yalu and Tumen rivers are in dispute with North Korea; North
Korea and China seek to stem illegal migration to China by North
Koreans, fleeing privations and oppression, by building a fence
along portions of the border and imprisoning North Koreans deported
by China; China and Russia have demarcated the once disputed islands
at the Amur and Ussuri confluence and in the Argun River in
accordance with their 2004 Agreement; China and Tajikistan have
begun demarcating the revised boundary agreed to in the delimitation
of 2002; the decade-long demarcation of the China-Vietnam land
boundary was completed in 2009; citing environmental, cultural, and
social concerns, China has reconsidered construction of 13 dams on
the Salween River, but energy-starved Burma, with backing from
Thailand, remains intent on building five hydro-electric dams
downstream despite regional and international protests; Chinese and
Hong Kong authorities met in March 2008 to resolve ownership and use
of lands recovered in Shenzhen River channelization, including
96-hectare Lok Ma Chau Loop; Hong Kong developing plans to reduce
2,000 out of 2,800 hectares of its restricted Closed Area by 2010



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 300,897 (Vietnam); estimated
30,000-50,000 (North Korea)

IDPs: 90,000 (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: China is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
sexual exploitation and forced labor; the majority of trafficking in
China occurs within the country's borders, but there is also
considerable international trafficking of Chinese citizens to
Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North
America; Chinese women are lured abroad through false promises of
legitimate employment, only to be forced into commercial sexual
exploitation, largely in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan;
women and children are trafficked to China from Mongolia, Burma,
North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam for forced labor, marriage, and
prostitution; some North Korean women and children seeking to leave
their country voluntarily cross the border into China and are then
sold into prostitution, marriage, or forced labor

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - China is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for the fourth consecutive year for its failure to provide evidence
of increasing efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly in
terms of punishment of trafficking crimes and the protection of
Chinese and foreign victims of trafficking; victims are sometimes
punished for unlawful acts that were committed as a direct result of
their being trafficked, such as violations of prostitution or
immigration/emigration controls; the Chinese Government continued to
treat North Korean victims of trafficking solely as economic
migrants, routinely deporting them back to horrendous conditions in
North Korea; additional challenges facing the Chinese Government
include the enormous size of its trafficking problem and the
significant level of corruption and complicity in trafficking by
some local government officials (2008)



Illicit drugs:


major transshipment point for heroin produced in the Golden Triangle
region of Southeast Asia; growing domestic consumption of synthetic
drugs, and heroin from Southeast and Southwest Asia; source country
for methamphetamine and heroin chemical precursors, despite new
regulations on its large chemical industry (2008)
