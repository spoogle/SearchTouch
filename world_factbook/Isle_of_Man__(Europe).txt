Isle of Man  (Europe)

Introduction ::Isle of Man




Background:


Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the 13th century
when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the British crown
in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost extinct Manx
Gaelic language. Isle of Man is a British crown dependency but is
not part of the UK or of the European Union. However, the UK
Government remains constitutionally responsible for its defense and
international representation.

Economy ::Isle of Man




Economy - overview:


Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the
economy. The government offers low taxes and other incentives to
high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on
the island; this has paid off in expanding employment opportunities
in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing,
once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
contributions to GDP. The Isle of Man also attracts online gambling
sites and the film industry. Trade is mostly with the UK. The Isle
of Man enjoys free access to EU markets.
