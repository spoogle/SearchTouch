Belarus  (Europe)

Introduction ::Belarus




Background:


After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus
attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer political
and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet
republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union
on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic
integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the
accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his
election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Aleksandr
LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian
means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press,
peaceful assembly, and religion remain in place.

Economy ::Belarus




Economy - overview:


Belarus has seen limited structural reform since 1995, when
President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of "market
socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed
administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
enterprises. Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number
of private companies. In addition, businesses have been subjected to
pressure by central and local governments, including arbitrary
changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive
application of new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive"
businessmen and factory owners. Continued state control over
economic operations hampers market entry for businesses, both
domestic and foreign. Government statistics indicate GDP growth was
strong, surpassing 10% in 2008, despite the roadblocks of a tough,
centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low
rate of unemployment. However, the global crisis pushed the country
into recession in 2009, and GDP grew only 0.2% for the year.
Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard. Minsk has
depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance
of payments shortfalls. In line with IMF conditions, in 2009,
Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40% and tightened some fiscal
and monetary policies. On 1 January 2010, Russia, Kazakhstan and
Belarus launched a customs union, with unified trade regulations and
customs codes still under negotiation. In late January, Russia and
Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement. The new terms
raised prices for above quota purchases, increasing Belarus' current
account deficit. GDP grew 4.8% in 2010, in part, on the strength of
renewed export growth. In December 2010, Belarus, Russia and
Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and
Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties.
