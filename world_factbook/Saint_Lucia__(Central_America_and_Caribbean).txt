Saint Lucia  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Saint Lucia




Background:


The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries, was contested
between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th
centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally ceded to
the UK in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its
plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island,
dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was
granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.

Economy ::Saint Lucia




Economy - overview:


The island nation has been able to attract foreign business and
investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism
industries, with a surge in foreign direct investment in 2006,
attributed to the construction of several tourism projects. Although
crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for
export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of income and the
industry is the island's biggest employer. Tourism is the main
source of foreign exchange, although tourism sector revenues
declined with the global economic downturn as US and European travel
dropped in 2009. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the
Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalize
the banana industry, although recent hurricanes have caused exports
to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external
shocks including volatile tourism receipts, natural disasters, and
dependence on foreign oil. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77%
and high debt servicing obligations constrain the KING
administration's ability to respond to adverse external shocks.
Economic fundamentals remain solid, even though unemployment needs
to be reduced.
