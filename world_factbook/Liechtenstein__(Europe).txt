Liechtenstein  (Europe)

Introduction ::Liechtenstein




Background:


The Principality of Liechtenstein was established within the Holy
Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and Russian troops
during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign state in 1806 and
joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815. Liechtenstein became
fully independent in 1866 when the Confederation dissolved. Until
the end of World War I, it was closely tied to Austria, but the
economic devastation caused by that conflict forced Liechtenstein to
enter into a customs and monetary union with Switzerland. Since
World War II (in which Liechtenstein remained neutral), the
country's low taxes have spurred outstanding economic growth. In
2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory oversight resulted in
concerns about the use of financial institutions for money
laundering. However, Liechtenstein implemented anti-money-laundering
legislation and a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US that
went into effect in 2003.

Economy ::Liechtenstein




Economy - overview:


Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein
has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized,
free-enterprise economy with a vital financial service sector and
the highest per capita income in the world. The Liechtenstein
economy is widely diversified with a large number of small
businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and
easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to
establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state
revenues. The country participates in a customs union with
Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It
imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has
been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving
as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and
the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its
economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008,
Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure -
particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking
and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax
Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's
conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD
in October 2009 removed the principality from its "grey list" of
countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax
Convention.
