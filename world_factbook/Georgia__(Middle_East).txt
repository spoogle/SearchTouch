Georgia  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Georgia




Background:


The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient kingdoms of
Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman influence in
the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the state religion
in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks was followed
by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was cut short by
the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman and Persian
empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia was absorbed
into the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Independent for three
years (1918-1921) following the Russian revolution, it was forcibly
incorporated into the USSR until the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
An attempt by the incumbent Georgian government to manipulate
national legislative elections in November 2003 touched off
widespread protests that led to the resignation of Eduard
SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early 2004
swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National
Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has
been made in the years since independence, but this progress has
been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway
regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and
separatist provocations in summer 2008, Georgian military action in
South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response
that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large portions of
Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most
occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia
unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South
Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's
nations and international organizations.

Economy ::Georgia




Economy - overview:


Georgia's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10% in 2006-07,
based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust government
spending. However, GDP growth slowed in 2008 following the August
2008 conflict with Russia, and turned negative in 2009 as foreign
direct investment and workers' remittances declined in the wake of
the global financial crisis, but rebounded in 2010. Georgia's main
economic activities include the cultivation of agricultural products
such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts; mining of manganese
and copper; and output of a small industrial sector producing
alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals, machinery, aircraft
and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement include growth in the
construction, banking services, and mining sectors, but reduced
availability of external investment and the slowing regional economy
are emerging risks. The country imports nearly all its needed
supplies of natural gas and oil products. It has sizeable hydropower
capacity, a growing component of its energy supplies. Georgia has
overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas supply interruptions
of the past by renovating hydropower plants and by increasingly
relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan instead of from
Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline,
the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, and the Kars-Akhalkalaki
Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on Georgia's strategic
location between Europe and Asia and develop its role as a transit
point for gas, oil and other goods. Georgia has historically
suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax revenues; however,
the government, since coming to power in 2004, has simplified the
tax code, improved tax administration, increased tax enforcement,
and cracked down on petty corruption. However, the economic downturn
of 2008-09 eroded the tax base and led to a decline in the budget
surplus and an increase in public borrowing needs. The country is
pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a determined effort to
continue to liberalize the economy by reducing regulation, taxes,
and corruption in order to attract foreign investment, but the
economy faces a more difficult investment climate both domestically
and internationally.
