Introduction ::Libya




Background:


The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around Tripoli
in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when defeated
in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and achieved
independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col. Muammar
Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political system, the
Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of socialism and
Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is supposed to be
implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of
"direct democracy." QADHAFI has always seen himself as a
revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during the
1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya, supporting
subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of Marxism and
capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged in military
operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain access to
minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian politics - but
was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992 isolated QADHAFI
politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. During the 1990s, QADHAFI began to rebuild his
relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended in April 1999
and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya accepted
responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003, Libya
announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to
develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism.
QADHAFI has made significant strides in normalizing relations with
Western nations since then. He has received various Western European
leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations,
and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he
traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's
designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In January
2008, Libya assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council
for the 2008-09 term. In August 2008, the US and Libya signed a
bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate
claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands
of the other country, including the Lockerbie bombing, the LaBelle
disco bombing, and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008, the US
Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to
distribute to US national claimants, and as a result effectively
normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya. The two countries
then exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 1973 in January
2009. Libya in May 2010 was elected to its first three-year seat on
the UN Human Rights Council, prompting protests from international
non-governmental organizations and human rights campaigners.

Economy ::Libya




Economy - overview:


The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
sector, which contribute about 95% of export earnings, 25% of GDP,
and 80% of government revenue. The weakness in world hydrocarbon
prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government tax income and constrained
economic growth. Substantial revenues from the energy sector coupled
with a small population give Libya one of the highest per capita
GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower
orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years have made
progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign to
reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort
picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and
as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs
to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting US
unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were
removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct
investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas
licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the
National Oil Corporation (NOC) set a goal of nearly doubling oil
production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC
announced that that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces
a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy,
but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership, reducing
some subsidies, and announcing plans for privatization - are laying
the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The
non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for
more than 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils
severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of
its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the
Great Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being
invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.
