Peru  (South America)

Introduction ::Peru




Background:


Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean civilizations,
most notably that of the Incas whose empire was captured by the
Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence was declared in
1821, and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824. After a dozen
years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic leadership in
1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth of a violent
insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in 1990 ushered in
a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the economy and
significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity. Nevertheless,
the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian measures and an
economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting dissatisfaction
with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A caretaker
government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001, which
ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of government -
Peru's first democratically elected president of Native American
ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return of Alan
GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term from 1985
to 1990, has overseen a robust macroeconomic performance.

Economy ::Peru




Economy - overview:


Peru's economy reflects its varied geography - an arid coastal
region, the Andes further inland, and tropical lands bordering
Colombia and Brazil. Abundant mineral resources are found in the
mountainous areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent
fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by more than 4% per year
during the period 2002-06, with a stable exchange rate and low
inflation. Growth jumped to 9% per year in 2007 and 2008, driven by
higher world prices for minerals and metals and the government's
aggressive trade liberalization strategies, but then fell to less
than 1% in 2009 in the face of the world recession and lower
commodity export prices. Growth resumed in 2010 at nearly 8%, due
partly to increased exports. Peru's rapid expansion has helped to
reduce the national poverty rate by about 15% since 2002, though
underemployment remains high; inflation has trended downward in
2009, to below the Central Bank's 1-3% target. Despite Peru's strong
macroeconomic performance, overdependence on minerals and metals
subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices, and poor
infrastructure precludes the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal
areas. Not all Peruvians therefore have shared in the benefits of
growth and despite President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and
macroeconomic policies, persistent inequality has cost him political
support. Nevertheless, he remains committed to Peru's free-trade
path. Since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the United
States, Canada, Singapore, and China, concluded negotiations with
the European Union, and begun trade talks with Korea, Japan, and
others. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) entered into
force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and
investment between the two economies.

Disputes - international:

boundaries along the parallels of latitude to equidistance lines
which favor Peru; organized illegal narcotics operations in Colombia
have penetrated Peru's shared border; Peru rejects Bolivia's claim
to restore maritime access through a sovereign corridor through
Chile along the Peruvian border



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 60,000-150,000 (civil war from 1980-2000; most IDPs are
indigenous peasants in Andean and Amazonian regions) (2007)



Illicit drugs:


until 1996 the world's largest coca leaf producer, Peru is now the
world's second largest producer of coca leaf, though it lags far
behind Colombia; cultivation of coca in Peru declined to 36,000
hectares in 2007; second largest producer of cocaine, estimated at
210 metric tons of potential pure cocaine in 2007; finished cocaine
is shipped out from Pacific ports to the international drug market;
increasing amounts of base and finished cocaine, however, are being
moved to Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia for use in the
Southern Cone or transshipment to Europe and Africa; increasing
domestic drug consumption
