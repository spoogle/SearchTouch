Brazil  (South America)

Introduction ::Brazil




Background:


Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule, Brazil
gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical system of
government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the subsequent
proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889. Brazilian coffee
exporters politically dominated the country until populist leader
Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the largest and most
populous country in South America, Brazil underwent more than half a
century of populist and military government until 1985, when the
military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian rulers. Brazil
continues to pursue industrial and agricultural growth and
development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a
large labor pool, it is today South America's leading economic power
and a regional leader, one of the first in the area to begin an
economic recovery. Highly unequal income distribution and crime
remain pressing problems. In January 2010, Brazil assumed a
nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.

Flag description:


green with a large yellow diamond in the center bearing a blue
celestial globe with 27 white five-pointed stars; the globe has a
white equatorial band with the motto ORDEM E PROGRESSO (Order and
Progress); the current flag was inspired by the banner of the former
Empire of Brazil (1822-1889); on the imperial flag, the green
represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of
Brazil, while the yellow stood for the Habsburg Family of his wife;
on the modern flag the green represents the forests of the country
and the yellow rhombus its mineral wealth; the blue circle and
stars, which replaced the coat of arms of the original flag, depict
the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the morning of 15 November 1889 - the
day the Republic of Brazil was declared; the number of stars has
changed with the creation of new states and has risen from an
original 21 to the current 27 (one for each state and the Federal
District)

name: "Hino Nacional Brasileiro" (Brazilian National Anthem)

Economy ::Brazil




Economy - overview:


Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural, mining,
manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that
of all other South American countries, and Brazil is expanding its
presence in world markets. Since 2003, Brazil has steadily improved
its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign reserves, and
reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden toward real
denominated and domestically held instruments. In 2008, Brazil
became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies awarded
investment grade status to its debt. After record growth in 2007 and
2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil in
September 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as
global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and
external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first
emerging markets to begin a recovery. Consumer and investor
confidence revived and GDP growth returned to positive in 2010,
boosted by an export recovery. Brazil's strong growth and high
interest rates make it an attractive destination for foreign
investors. Large capital inflows over the past year have contributed
to the rapid appreciation of its currency and led the government to
raise taxes on some foreign investments. President Dilma ROUSSEFF
has pledged to retain the previous administration's commitment to
inflation targeting by the Central Bank, a floating exchange rate,
and fiscal restraint.
