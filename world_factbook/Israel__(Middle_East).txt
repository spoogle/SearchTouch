Israel  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Israel




Background:


Following World War II, the British withdrew from their mandate of
Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and Jewish
states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently, the
Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending the
deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel occupied
since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country profile,
unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew from the
Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In keeping
with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in October
1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel and
Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent
settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September
1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords")
guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding
territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26
October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May
2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it
had occupied since 1982. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working
in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took
the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the
conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties
leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However,
progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by
Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February
2005. In the summer of 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the
Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining
control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election
of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations
between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT
became prime minister in March 2006 and presided over a 34-day
conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day
conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and
January 2009. OLMERT, who in June 2007 resumed talks with PA
President Mahmoud ABBAS, resigned in September 2008. Prime Minister
Binyamin NETANYAHU formed a coalition in March 2009 following a
February 2009 general election. Direct talks launched in September
2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial
settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank. Diplomatic
initiatives to revive the negotiations through proximity talks began
at the end of 2010.

Economy ::Israel




Economy - overview:


Israel has a technologically advanced market economy. It depends on
imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed
its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Cut
diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel usually
posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large transfer
payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the
government's external debt is owed to the US, its major source of
economic and military aid. Israel's GDP, after contracting slightly
in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and troubles in the
high-technology sector, grew about 5% per year from 2004-07. The
global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief recession in
Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid fundamentals -
following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series of
liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector, and the
economy has shown signs of an early recovery. Following GDP growth
of 4% in 2008, Israel's GDP slipped to 0.2% in 2009, but reached
3.4% in 2010, as exports rebounded. The global economic downturn
affected Israel's economy primarily through reduced demand for
Israel's exports in the United States and EU, Israel's top trading
partners. Exports account for about 25% of the country's GDP. The
Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a
modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary
monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows,
purchasing government bonds, and intervening in the foreign currency
market. The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the
summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank's
target and the economy began to show signs of recovery.
