Timor-Leste  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Timor-Leste




Background:


The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor in the early
16th century and colonized it in mid-century. Skirmishing with the
Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an 1859 treaty in which
Portugal ceded the western portion of the island. Imperial Japan
occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945, but Portugal resumed
colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in World War II. East
Timor declared itself independent from Portugal on 28 November 1975
and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian forces nine days later.
It was incorporated into Indonesia in July 1976 as the province of
Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful campaign of pacification
followed over the next two decades, during which an estimated
100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives. On 30 August 1999,
in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an overwhelming majority of
the people of Timor-Leste voted for independence from Indonesia.
Between the referendum and the arrival of a multinational
peacekeeping force in late September 1999, anti-independence
Timorese militias - organized and supported by the Indonesian
military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of
retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400 Timorese and
forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as refugees. The
majority of the country's infrastructure, including homes,
irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly
100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20
September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the
International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the
country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002,
Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state.
In late April 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's
security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown
of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International
Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In
August, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated
Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police
presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored
stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in
April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February
2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the
president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the
attack and the majority of the rebels surrendered in April 2008.
Since the unsuccessful attacks the government has enjoyed one of its
longest periods of post-independence stability.

Economy ::Timor-Leste




Economy - overview:


In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure of
Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and
anti-independence militias. Three hundred thousand people fled
westward. Over the next three years a massive international program,
manned by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police
officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural
areas. By the end of 2005, refugees had returned or had settled in
Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in
rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil
administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the
work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore
waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This
technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create
jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities
in Timor. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National
Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to
serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the
value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The
Fund held assets of US$5.3 billion as of October 2009. The economy
has been little impacted by the global financial crisis and
continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence
and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector
economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of
thousands of an estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons
(IDPs); most IDPs returned home by early 2009. The underlying
economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use
oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth
path and to reduce poverty.
