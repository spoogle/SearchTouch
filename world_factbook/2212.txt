Field Listing :: Urbanization

  This entry provides two measures of the degree of urbanization of a
  population. The first, urban population, describes the percentage of
  the total population living in urban areas, as defined by the
  country. The second, rate of urbanization, describes the projected
  average rate of change of the size of the urban population over the
  given period of time. Additionally, the World entry includes a list
  of the ten largest urban agglomerations. An urban agglomeration is
  defined as comprising the city or town proper and also the suburban
  fringe or thickly settled territory lying outside of, but adjacent
  to, the boundaries of the city.
