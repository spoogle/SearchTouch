Malaysia  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Malaysia




Background:


During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain established
colonies and protectorates in the area of current Malaysia; these
were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948, the British-ruled
territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the Federation of Malaya,
which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when
the former British colonies of Singapore and the East Malaysian
states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of Borneo joined
the Federation. The first several years of the country's history
were marred by a Communist insurgency, Indonesian confrontation with
Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and Singapore's secession from
the Federation in 1965. During the 22-year term of Prime Minister
MAHATHIR bin Mohamad (1981-2003), Malaysia was successful in
diversifying its economy from dependence on exports of raw materials
to expansion in manufacturing, services, and tourism.

Economy ::Malaysia




Economy - overview:


Malaysia, a middle-income country, has transformed itself since the
1970s from a producer of raw materials into an emerging multi-sector
economy. Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia is attempting
to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move farther up the
value-added production chain by attracting investments in Islamic
finance, high technology industries, medical technology, and
pharmaceuticals. The NAJIB administration also is continuing efforts
to boost domestic demand and to wean the economy off of its
dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports - particularly of
electronics - remain a significant driver of the economy. As an oil
and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from higher world energy
prices, although the rising cost of domestic gasoline and diesel
fuel, combined with strained government finances, has forced Kuala
Lumpur to reduce government subsidies. The government is also trying
to lessen its dependence on state oil producer Petronas, which
supplies at least 40% of government revenue. The central bank
maintains healthy foreign exchange reserves and its well-developed
regulatory regime has limited Malaysia's exposure to riskier
financial instruments and the global financial crisis. Nevertheless,
decreasing worldwide demand for consumer goods hurt Malaysia's
exports and economic growth in 2009, although both showed signs of
recovery in 2010. In order to attract increased investment, NAJIB
has also sought to revise the special economic and social
preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the New Economic Policy
of 1970, but he has encountered significant opposition, especially
from Malay nationalists.

ports in East Asia; crews have been murdered or cast adrift;
increased naval patrols in 2009 resulted in significantly reduced

Transnational Issues ::Malaysia




Disputes - international:


Malaysia is involved in a complex dispute with Brunei, China,
Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam over claims to part or all of the
Spratly Islands; while the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of
Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions over the Spratly
Islands, it is not the legally binding "code of conduct" sought by
some parties; Malaysia was not party to the March 2005 joint accord
among the national oil companies of China, the Philippines, and
Vietnam on conducting marine seismic activities in the Spratly
Islands; disputes continue over deliveries of fresh water to
Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation, bridge construction, and
maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore Straits; in 2008, ICJ
awards sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu Puteh/Horsburgh
Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia, but does not
rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of South Ledge;
ICJ awarded Ligitan and Sipadan islands, also claimed by Indonesia
and Philippines, to Malaysia but left maritime boundary and
sovereignty of Unarang rock in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea in
dispute; separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Muslim
southern provinces prompts measures to close and monitor border with
Malaysia to stem terrorist activities; Philippines retains a dormant
claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo; Brunei and
Malaysia agreed in September 2008 to resolve their offshore and
deepwater seabed dispute, resume hydrocarbon exploration, and
renounce any territorial claims along their land boundary; piracy
remains a problem in the Malacca Strait



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 15,174 (Indonesia); 21,544 (Burma)
(2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Malaysia is a destination and, to a lesser
extent, a source and transit country for women and children
trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, and
men, women, and children for forced labor; Malaysia is mainly a
destination country for men, women, and children who migrate
willingly from South and Southeast Asia to work, some of whom are
subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude by Malaysian
employers in the domestic, agricultural, construction, plantation,
and industrial sectors; to a lesser extent, some Malaysian women,
primarily of Chinese ethnicity, are trafficked abroad for commercial
sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Malaysia does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so, despite
some progress in enforcing the 2007 comprehensive anti-trafficking
law; it has yet to fully address labor trafficking in Malaysia;
there are credible allegations of involvement of Malaysian
immigration officials in trafficking and extorting Burmese refugees;
the government did not develop mechanisms to effectively screen
victims of trafficking in vulnerable groups and condones the
confiscation of passports of migrant workers by employers (2009)



Illicit drugs:


drug trafficking prosecuted vigorously and carries severe penalties;
heroin still primary drug of abuse, but synthetic drug demand
remains strong; continued ecstasy and methamphetamine producer for
domestic users and, to a lesser extent, the regional drug market
