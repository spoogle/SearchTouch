Morocco  (Africa)

Introduction ::Morocco




Background:


In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North Africa,
successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In the 16th
century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad AL-MANSUR
(1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a golden age.
The Alaouite dynasty, to which the current Moroccan royal family
belongs, established a sultanate in Morocco beginning in the 17th
century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and ushered in a
half century of trade rivalry among European powers that saw
Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French imposed a
protectorate over the country. A protracted independence struggle
with France ended successfully in 1956. The internationalized city
of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were turned over to the new
country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V, the current monarch's
grandfather, organized the new state as a constitutional monarchy
and in 1957 assumed the title of King. Morocco annexed Western
Sahara during the late 1970s, but final resolution on the status of
the territory remains unresolved. Gradual political reforms in the
1990s resulted in the establishment of a bicameral legislature,
which first met in 1997. Under King MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999
succeeded his father to the throne - human rights have improved.
Morocco enjoys a moderately free press, but the government
occasionally takes action against journalists who report on three
broad subjects considered to be taboo: the monarchy, Islam, and the
status of Western Sahara. Despite the continuing reforms, ultimate
authority remains in the hands of the monarch.

Economy ::Morocco




Economy - overview:


Morocco's market economy benefits from the country's relatively low
labor costs and proximity to Europe, which aid key areas of the
economy such as agriculture, light manufacturing, tourism, and
remittances. Morocco is also the world's largest exporter of
phosphate, which has long provided a source of export earnings and
economic stability. Economic policies pursued since 2003 by King
MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the country with
generally low inflation, improved financial performance, and steady
progress in developing the service and industrial sectors. In 2006,
Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US, and in
2008 entered into an advanced status in its 2000 Association
Agreement with the EU. However, poverty, illiteracy, and
unemployment rates remain high. In response to these challenges,
King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for Human
Development, a $2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty and
underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and
replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing, among
other policies. Morocco's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010,
and reducing govenment spending and adapting to sluggish economic
growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011. Morocco's long-term
challenges include improving education and job prospects for young
Moroccans, closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the
poor, confronting corruption, and expanding and diversifying exports
beyond phosphates and low-value-added products.

Transnational Issues ::Morocco




Disputes - international:


claims and administers Western Sahara whose sovereignty remains
unresolved - UN-administered cease-fire has remained in effect since
September 1991, but attempts to hold a referendum have failed and
parties thus far have rejected all brokered proposals; Morocco
protests Spain's control over the coastal enclaves of Ceuta,
Melilla, and Penon de Velez de la Gomera, the islands of Penon de
Alhucemas and Islas Chafarinas, and surrounding waters; both
countries claim Isla Perejil (Leila Island); discussions have not
progressed on a comprehensive maritime delimitation, setting limits
on resource exploration and refugee interdiction, since Morocco's
2002 rejection of Spain's unilateral designation of a median line
from the Canary Islands; Morocco serves as one of the primary
launching areas of illegal migration into Spain from North Africa



Illicit drugs:


one of the world's largest producers of illicit hashish; shipments
of hashish mostly directed to Western Europe; transit point for
