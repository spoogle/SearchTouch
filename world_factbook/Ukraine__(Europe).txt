Ukraine  (Europe)

Introduction ::Ukraine




Background:


Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state, Kyivan
Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest and
most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels and
Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand Duchy
of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.
The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid the foundation
for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent centuries. A new
Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was established during the
mid-17th century after an uprising against the Poles. Despite
continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate managed to remain
autonomous for well over 100 years. During the latter part of the
18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic territory was absorbed by
the Russian Empire. Following the collapse of czarist Russia in
1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived period of
independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to endure a
brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines (1921-22 and
1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II, German and
Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million more deaths.
Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in 1991 with
the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity remained
elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic corruption
stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and civil
liberties. A peaceful mass protest "Orange Revolution" in the
closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged
presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored
vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor
YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp
allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in
parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006.
An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in
the spring of 2007, saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO, as head of an "Orange"
coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007.
Viktor YANUKOVUYCH was elected president in a February 2010 run-off
election that observers assessed as meeting most international
standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of
no-confidence prompting Yuliya TYMOSHENKO to resign from her post as
prime minister.

Economy ::Ukraine




Economy - overview:


After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most
important economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing
about four times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its
fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise,
its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for
example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and
mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the
former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the
Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform
within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform
efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to
less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for
energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have
made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine
depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and
natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a
two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine
agreed to ten-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in
January 2009 that brought gas prices to "world" levels. The strict
terms of the contracts have further hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped
state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside institutions - particularly the
IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of
reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and
customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more
economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more
improvements are needed, including fighting corruption, developing
capital markets, and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's
economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime
minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth exceeded 7%
in 2006-07, fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top
export - and by strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising
pensions and wages. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a
$16.4 billion Stand-By Arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the
economic crisis, but the Ukrainian Government's lack of progress in
implementing reforms has twice delayed the release of IMF assistance
funds. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global
financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth
in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15% in 2009, among the
worst economic performances in the world; growth resumed in 2010,
buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to hamper efforts
for economic recovery in 2011.

Telephone system:


general assessment: Ukraine's telecommunication development plan
emphasizes improving domestic trunk lines, international
connections, and the mobile-cellular system

domestic: at independence in December 1991, Ukraine inherited a
telephone system that was antiquated, inefficient, and in disrepair;
more than 3.5 million applications for telephones could not be
satisfied; telephone density is rising and the domestic trunk system
is being improved; about one-third of Ukraine's networks are digital
and a majority of regional centers now have digital switching
stations; improvements in local networks and local exchanges
continue to lag; the mobile-cellular telephone system's expansion
has slowed, largely due to saturation of the market which has
reached 120 mobile phones per 100 people

international: country code - 380; 2 new domestic trunk lines are a
part of the fiber-optic Trans-Asia-Europe (TAE) system and 3
Ukrainian links have been installed in the fiber-optic
Trans-European Lines (TEL) project that connects 18 countries;
additional international service is provided by the
Italy-Turkey-Ukraine-Russia (ITUR) fiber-optic submarine cable and
by an unknown number of earth stations in the Intelsat, Inmarsat,
and Intersputnik satellite systems



Broadcast media:


TV coverage is provided by Ukraine's state-controlled nationwide
broadcast channel (UT1) and a number of privately-owned television
broadcast networks; Russian television broadcasts have a small
audience nationwide, but larger audiences in the eastern and
southern regions; multi-channel cable and satellite TV services are
available; Ukraine's radio broadcast market, a mix of independent
and state-owned networks, is comprised of some 300 stations (2007)

Transnational Issues ::Ukraine




Disputes - international:


1997 boundary delimitation treaty with Belarus remains un-ratified

reducing border security; delimitation of land boundary with Russia
is complete with preparations for demarcation underway; the dispute
over the boundary between Russia and Ukraine through the Kerch
Strait and Sea of Azov remains unresolved despite a December 2003
framework agreement and ongoing expert-level discussions; Moldova
and Ukraine operate joint customs posts to monitor transit of people
and commodities through Moldova's break-away Transnistria Region,
which remains under OSCE supervision; the ICJ gave Ukraine until
December 2006 to reply, and Romania until June 2007 to rejoin, in
their dispute submitted in 2004 over Ukrainian-administered
Zmiyinyy/Serpilor (Snake) Island and Black Sea maritime boundary;
Romania opposes Ukraine's reopening of a navigation canal from the
Danube border through Ukraine to the Black Sea



Illicit drugs:


limited cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy, mostly for CIS
consumption; some synthetic drug production for export to the West;
limited government eradication program; used as transshipment point
for opiates and other illicit drugs from Africa, Latin America, and
Turkey to Europe and Russia; Ukraine has improved
anti-money-laundering controls, resulting in its removal from the
Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's) Noncooperative Countries and
Territories List in February 2004; Ukraine's anti-money-laundering
regime continues to be monitored by FATF
