  This entry usually highlights major historic events and current
  issues and may include a statement about one or two key future
  trends.
  Country


  Background

Afghanistan
  Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and
  founded Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between
  the British and Russian Empires until it won independence from
  notional British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy
  ended in a 1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet
  Union invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist
  regime, touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew
  in 1989 under relentless pressure by internationally supported
  anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
  saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
  Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
  country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
  terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US,
  Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled
  the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn
  Conference in 2001 established a process for political
  reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a
  presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in
  2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically
  elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was
  inaugurated the following December. Karzai was re-elected in August
  2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable
  central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial
  instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain
  serious challenges for the Afghan Government.

Akrotiri
  By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created
  the independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty
  and jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers -
  Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The southernmost and smallest of these is the
  Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area, which is also referred to as the
  Western Sovereign Base Area.

Albania
  Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in
  1912, but was conquered by Italy in 1939. Communist partisans took
  over the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR
  (until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s,
  Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established
  a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as
  successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment,
  widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure,
  powerful organized crime networks, and combative political
  opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development
  since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies
  remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free
  and fair since the restoration of political stability following the
  collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however, there have been claims
  of electoral fraud in every one of Albania's post-communist
  elections. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party and
  its allies won a decisive victory on pledges to reduce crime and
  corruption, promote economic growth, and decrease the size of
  government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition of
  power, was considered an important step forward. Albania joined NATO
  in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession.
  Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still
  one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy
  and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure.

Algeria
  After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians
  fought through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962.
  Algeria's primary political party, the National Liberation Front
  (FLN), was established in 1954 as part of the struggle for
  independence and has largely dominated politics since. The
  Government of Algeria in 1988 instituted a multi-party system in
  response to public unrest, but the surprising first round success of
  the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in the December 1991 balloting
  spurred the Algerian army to intervene and postpone the second round
  of elections to prevent what the secular elite feared would be an
  extremist-led government from assuming power. The army began a
  crackdown on the FIS that spurred FIS supporters to begin attacking
  government targets, and fighting escalated into an insurgency, which
  saw intense violence between 1992-98 resulting in over 100,000
  deaths - many attributed to indiscriminate massacres of villagers by
  extremists. The government gained the upper hand by the late-1990s,
  and FIS's armed wing, the Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in
  January 2000. Abdelaziz BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the
  military, won the presidency in 1999 in an election widely viewed as
  fraudulent, was reelected to a second term in 2004, and
  overwhelmingly won a third term in 2009 after the government amended
  the constitution in 2008 to remove presidential term limits.
  Longstanding problems continue to face BOUTEFLIKA, including
  large-scale unemployment, a shortage of housing, unreliable
  electrical and water supplies, government inefficiencies and
  corruption, and the continuing activities of extremist militants.
  The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC) in 2006 merged
  with al-Qai'da to form al-Qai'da in the Lands of the Islamic
  Maghreb, which has launched an ongoing series of kidnappings and
  bombings targeting the Algerian Government and Western interests.

American Samoa
  Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was "discovered"
  by European explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries
  in the latter half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899
  treaty in which Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago.
  The US formally occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern
  islands with the excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Andorra
  For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a
  unique co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from
  1607 onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Seu
  d'Urgell). In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular
  heads of state retained, but the government transformed into a
  parliamentary democracy. For decades Andorra enjoyed its status as a
  small refuge of fiscal and banking freedom and benefitted from
  Spanish and French tourists attracted to the country's duty-free
  shopping. The situation has changed in recent years as Andorra
  started to tax foreign investment and other sectors. Tourism
  accounts for over 80% of Andorra's gross domestic product.

Angola
  Angola is rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year
  civil war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the
  Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the
  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by
  Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace
  seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but
  fighting picked up again by 1996. Up to 1.5 million lives may have
  been lost - and 4 million people displaced - in the quarter century
  of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and
  strengthened the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS held
  legislative elections in September 2008 and, despite promising to
  hold presidential elections in 2009, has since made a presidential
  poll contingent on the drafting of a new constitution.

Anguilla
  Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650,
  Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th
  century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants -
  was incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint
  Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two
  years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this
  arrangement was formally recognized in 1980 with Anguilla becoming a
  separate British dependency.

Antarctica
  Speculation over the existence of a "southern land" was
  not confirmed until the early 1820s when British and American
  commercial operators and British and Russian national expeditions
  began exploring the Antarctic Peninsula region and other areas south
  of the Antarctic Circle. Not until 1840 was it established that
  Antarctica was indeed a continent and not just a group of islands or
  an area of ocean. Several exploration "firsts" were achieved in the
  early 20th century, but generally the area saw little human
  activity. Following World War II, however, there was an upsurge in
  scientific research on the continent. A number of countries have set
  up a range of year-round and seasonal stations, camps, and refuges
  to support scientific research in Antarctica. Seven have made
  territorial claims, but not all countries recognize these claims. In
  order to form a legal framework for the activities of nations on the
  continent, an Antarctic Treaty was negotiated that neither denies
  nor gives recognition to existing territorial claims; signed in
  1959, it entered into force in 1961.

Antigua and Barbuda
  The Siboney were the first to inhabit the
  islands of Antigua and Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians
  populated the islands when COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in
  1493. Early settlements by the Spanish and French were succeeded by
  the English who formed a colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run
  the sugar plantations on Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands
  became an independent state within the British Commonwealth of
  Nations in 1981.

Arctic Ocean
  The Arctic Ocean is the smallest of the world's five
  oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and
  the recently delimited Southern Ocean). The Northwest Passage (US
  and Canada) and Northern Sea Route (Norway and Russia) are two
  important seasonal waterways. In recent years the polar ice pack has
  thinned allowing for increased navigation and raising the
  possibility of future sovereignty and shipping disputes among
  countries bordering the Arctic Ocean.

Argentina
  In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared
  their independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay
  went their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina.
  The country's population and culture were heavily shaped by
  immigrants from throughout Europe, but most particularly Italy and
  Spain, which provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860
  to 1930. Up until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's
  history was dominated by periods of internal political conflict
  between Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military
  factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct
  and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was
  followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy
  returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland (Malvinas)
  Islands by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the
  most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02
  that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations
  of several presidents.

Armenia
  Armenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally
  adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy,
  over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires
  including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During
  World War I in the western portion of Armenia, Ottoman Turkey
  instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh
  practices that resulted in an estimated 1 million Armenian deaths.
  The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in
  1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was
  conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920. Armenian leaders remain
  preoccupied by the long conflict with Azerbaijan over
  Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily Armenian-populated region, assigned to
  Soviet Azerbaijan in the 1920s by Moscow. Armenia and Azerbaijan
  began fighting over the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after
  both countries attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
  By May 1994, when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces
  held not only Nagorno-Karabakh but also a significant portion of
  Azerbaijan proper. The economies of both sides have been hurt by
  their inability to make substantial progress toward a peaceful
  resolution. Turkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1994
  because of the Armenian separatists' control of Nagorno-Karabakh and
  surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In
  2009, senior Armenian leaders began pursuing rapprochement with
  Turkey, aiming to secure an opening of the border; this process is
  currently dormant.

Aruba
  Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired
  by the Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by
  three main industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by
  prosperity brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The
  last decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry.
  Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a
  separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
  Movement toward full independence was halted at Aruba's request in
  1990.

Ashmore and Cartier Islands
  These uninhabited islands came under
  Australian authority in 1931; formal administration began two years
  later. Ashmore Reef supports a rich and diverse avian and marine
  habitat; in 1983, it became a National Nature Reserve. Cartier
  Island, a former bombing range, became a marine reserve in 2000.

Atlantic Ocean
  The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the
  world's five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than the
  Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). The Kiel Canal
  (Germany), Oresund (Denmark-Sweden), Bosporus (Turkey), Strait of
  Gibraltar (Morocco-Spain), and the Saint Lawrence Seaway (Canada-US)
  are important strategic access waterways. The decision by the
  International Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to
  delimit a fifth world ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion
  of the Atlantic Ocean south of 60 degrees south latitude.

Australia
  Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from
  Southeast Asia about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began
  exploration in the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were
  made until 1770, when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name
  of Great Britain. Six colonies were created in the late 18th and
  19th centuries; they federated and became the Commonwealth of
  Australia in 1901. The new country took advantage of its natural
  resources to rapidly develop agricultural and manufacturing
  industries and to make a major contribution to the British effort in
  World Wars I and II. In recent decades, Australia has transformed
  itself into an internationally competitive, advanced market economy.
  It boasted one of the OECD's fastest growing economies during the
  1990s, a performance due in large part to economic reforms adopted
  in the 1980s. Long-term concerns include climate-change issues such
  as the depletion of the ozone layer and more frequent droughts, and
  management and conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great
  Barrier Reef.

Austria
  Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian
  Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in
  World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and
  subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's
  status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955
  ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
  unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
  declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
  Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
  Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the
  meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country,
  Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

Azerbaijan
  Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and
  majority-Muslim population - was briefly independent from 1918 to
  1920; it regained its independence after the collapse of the Soviet
  Union in 1991. Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to
  resolve its conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily
  Armenian-populated region that Moscow recognized as part of Soviet
  Azerbaijan in the 1920s after Armenia and Azerbaijan disputed the
  status of the territory. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over
  the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries
  attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994,
  when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only
  Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding provinces in the
  territory of Azerbaijan. Corruption in the country is ubiquitous,
  and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a
  2009 referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the
  poverty rate has been reduced in recent years due to revenue from
  oil production, the promise of widespread wealth resulting from the
  continued development of Azerbaijan's energy sector remains largely
  unfulfilled.

Bahamas, The
  Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher
  COLUMBUS first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492.
  British settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became
  a colony in 1783. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973,
  The Bahamas has prospered through tourism and international banking
  and investment management. Because of its geography, the country is
  a major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly
  shipments to the US and Europe, and its territory is used for
  smuggling illegal migrants into the US.

Bahrain
  In 1783, the al-Khalifa family captured Bahrain from the
  Persians. In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a
  series of treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made
  Bahrain a British protectorate. The archipelago attained its
  independence in 1971. Bahrain's small size and central location
  among Persian Gulf countries require it to play a delicate balancing
  act in foreign affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining
  oil reserves, Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and
  refining and has transformed itself into an international banking
  center. King HAMAD bin Isa al-Khalifa, after coming to power in
  1999, pushed economic and political reforms to improve relations
  with the Shia community. Shia political societies participated in
  2010 parliamentary and municipal elections. Al Wifaq, the largest
  Shia political society, won the largest number of seats in the
  elected chamber of the legislature. However, Shia discontent has
  resurfaced in recent years with street demonstrations and occasional
  low-level violence.

Bangladesh
  Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of
  Bangladesh in the 16th century; eventually the British came to
  dominate the region and it became part of British India. In 1947,
  West Pakistan and East Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from
  India (largely Hindu) and jointly became the new country of
  Pakistan. East Bengal became East Pakistan in 1955, but the awkward
  arrangement of a two-part country with its territorial units
  separated by 1,600 km left the Bengalis marginalized and
  dissatisfied. East Pakistan seceded from its union with West
  Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh. A military-backed,
  emergency caretaker regime suspended parliamentary elections planned
  for January 2007 in an effort to reform the political system and
  root out corruption. In contrast to the strikes and violent street
  rallies that had marked Bangladeshi politics in previous years, the
  parliamentary elections finally held in late December 2008 were
  mostly peaceful and Sheikh HASINA Wajed was elected prime minister.
  About a third of this extremely poor country floods annually during
  the monsoon rainy season, hampering economic development.

Barbados
  The island was uninhabited when first settled by the
  British in 1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on
  the island until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy
  remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production
  through most of the 20th century. The gradual introduction of social
  and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete
  independence from the UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and
  manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance.

Belarus
  After seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR,
  Belarus attained its independence in 1991. It has retained closer
  political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former
  Soviet republics. Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state
  union on 8 December 1999 envisioning greater political and economic
  integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the
  accord, serious implementation has yet to take place. Since his
  election in July 1994 as the country's first president, Aleksandr
  LUKASHENKO has steadily consolidated his power through authoritarian
  means. Government restrictions on freedom of speech and the press,
  peaceful assembly, and religion remain in place.

Belgium
  Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it
  was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country
  prospered in the past half century as a modern, technologically
  advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. Tensions
  between the Dutch-speaking Flemings of the north and the
  French-speaking Walloons of the south have led in recent years to
  constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition
  and autonomy.

Belize
  Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their
  decline at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and
  Spanish disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it
  formally became the colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial
  disputes between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of
  Belize until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation
  until 1992 and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border
  dispute. Guatemala and Belize plan to hold a simultaneous referendum
  to determine if this dispute will go before the International Court
  of Justice at The Hague, though they have not yet set a date.
  Tourism has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns
  include the country's heavy foreign debt burden, high unemployment,
  growing involvement in the South American drug trade, high crime
  rates, and increasing incidences of HIV/AIDS.

Benin
  Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West
  African kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became
  a French Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960,
  as the Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended
  in 1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the
  establishment of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles.
  A move to representative government began in 1989. Two years later,
  free elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as
  president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa
  from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by
  elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were
  alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006
  and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and
  independent. YAYI has begun a high profile fight against corruption
  and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin's economic growth.

Bermuda
  Bermuda was first settled in 1609 by shipwrecked English
  colonists headed for Virginia. Tourism to the island to escape North
  American winters first developed in Victorian times. Tourism
  continues to be important to the island's economy, although
  international business has overtaken it in recent years. Bermuda has
  developed into a highly successful offshore financial center.
  Although a referendum on independence from the UK was soundly
  defeated in 1995, the present government has reopened debate on the
  issue.

Bhutan
  In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu,
  under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for
  ceding some border land to British India. Under British influence, a
  monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed
  whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal
  affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs.
  This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years
  later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan
  annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country
  received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and
  foreign relations. A refugee issue of over 100,000 Bhutanese in
  Nepal remains unresolved; 90% of the refugees are housed in seven
  United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
  camps. In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the
  government's draft constitution - which would introduce major
  democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for
  its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne to his
  son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK, in order to give him experience
  as head of state before the democratic transition. In early 2007,
  India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty to allow Bhutan greater
  autonomy in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu
  continues to coordinate policy decisions in this area with New
  Delhi. In July 2007, seven ministers of Bhutan's ten-member cabinet
  resigned to join the political process, and the cabinet acted as a
  caretaker regime until democratic elections for seats to the
  country's first parliament were completed in March 2008. The king
  ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008.

Bolivia
  Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR,
  broke away from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history
  has consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.
  Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have
  faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
  illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected
  Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the
  widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule
  in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's
  traditional political class and empower the nation's poor,
  indigenous majority. However, since taking office, his controversial
  strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the
  Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous
  communities of the eastern lowlands. In December 2009, President
  MORALES easily won reelection, and his party took control of the
  legislative branch of the government, which will allow him to
  continue his process of change.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
  Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of
  sovereignty in October 1991 was followed by a declaration of
  independence from the former Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992 after a
  referendum boycotted by ethnic Serbs. The Bosnian Serbs - supported
  by neighboring Serbia and Montenegro - responded with armed
  resistance aimed at partitioning the republic along ethnic lines and
  joining Serb-held areas to form a "Greater Serbia." In March 1994,
  Bosniaks and Croats reduced the number of warring factions from
  three to two by signing an agreement creating a joint Bosniak/Croat
  Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 21 November 1995, in
  Dayton, Ohio, the warring parties initialed a peace agreement that
  brought to a halt three years of interethnic civil strife (the final
  agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Peace
  Accords retained Bosnia and Herzegovina's international boundaries
  and created a multi-ethnic and democratic government charged with
  conducting foreign, diplomatic, and fiscal policy. Also recognized
  was a second tier of government composed of two entities roughly
  equal in size: the Bosniak/Croat Federation of Bosnia and
  Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska (RS). The
  Federation and RS governments were charged with overseeing most
  government functions. The Dayton Accords also established the Office
  of the High Representative (OHR) to oversee the implementation of
  the civilian aspects of the agreement. The Peace Implementation
  Council (PIC) at its conference in Bonn in 1997 also gave the High
  Representative the authority to impose legislation and remove
  officials, the so-called "Bonn Powers." In 1995-96, a NATO-led
  international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of 60,000 troops served in
  Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects of the
  agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization
  Force (SFOR) whose mission was to deter renewed hostilities.
  European Union peacekeeping troops (EUFOR) replaced SFOR in December
  2004; their mission is to maintain peace and stability throughout
  the country. EUFOR's mission changed from peacekeeping to civil
  policing in October 2007, with its presence reduced from nearly
  7,000 to less than 2,500 troops. Troop strength at the end of 2009
  stood at roughly 2,000. In January 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina
  assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the
  2010-11 term.

Botswana
  Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana
  adopted its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of
  uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
  significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic
  economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,
  dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due
  to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature
  preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of
  HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and
  comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.

Bouvet Island
  This uninhabited volcanic island is almost entirely
  covered by glaciers and is difficult to approach. It was discovered
  in 1739 by a French naval officer after whom the island was named.
  No claim was made until 1825, when the British flag was raised. In
  1928, the UK waived its claim in favor of Norway, which had occupied
  the island the previous year. In 1971, Norway designated Bouvet
  Island and the adjacent territorial waters a nature reserve. Since
  1977, it has run an automated meteorological station on the island.

Brazil
  Following more than three centuries under Portuguese rule,
  Brazil gained its independence in 1822, maintaining a monarchical
  system of government until the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the
  subsequent proclamation of a republic by the military in 1889.
  Brazilian coffee exporters politically dominated the country until
  populist leader Getulio VARGAS rose to power in 1930. By far the
  largest and most populous country in South America, Brazil underwent
  more than half a century of populist and military government until
  1985, when the military regime peacefully ceded power to civilian
  rulers. Brazil continues to pursue industrial and agricultural
  growth and development of its interior. Exploiting vast natural
  resources and a large labor pool, it is today South America's
  leading economic power and a regional leader, one of the first in
  the area to begin an economic recovery. Highly unequal income
  distribution and crime remain pressing problems. In January 2010,
  Brazil assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for
  the 2010-11 term.

British Indian Ocean Territory
  Formerly administered as part of the
  British Crown Colony of Mauritius, the British Indian Ocean
  Territory (BIOT) was established as an overseas territory of the UK
  in 1965. A number of the islands of the territory were later
  transferred to the Seychelles when it attained independence in 1976.
  Subsequently, BIOT has consisted only of the six main island groups
  comprising the Chagos Archipelago. The largest and most southerly of
  the islands, Diego Garcia, contains a joint UK-US naval support
  facility. All of the remaining islands are uninhabited. Between 1967
  and 1973, former agricultural workers, earlier residents in the
  islands, were relocated primarily to Mauritius, but also to the
  Seychelles. Negotiations between 1971 and 1982 resulted in the
  establishment of a trust fund by the British Government as
  compensation for the displaced islanders, known as Chagossians.
  Beginning in 1998, the islanders pursued a series of lawsuits
  against the British Government seeking further compensation and the
  right to return to the territory. In 2006 and 2007, British court
  rulings invalidated the immigration policies contained in the 2004
  BIOT Constitution Order that had excluded the islanders from the
  archipelago, but upheld the special military status of Diego Garcia.
  In 2008, the House of Lords, as the final court of appeal in the UK,
  ruled in favor of the British Government by overturning the lower
  court rulings and finding no right of return for the Chagossians.

British Virgin Islands
  First inhabited by Arawak and later by Carib
  Indians, the Virgin Islands were settled by the Dutch in 1648 and
  then annexed by the English in 1672. The islands were part of the
  British colony of the Leeward Islands from 1872-1960; they were
  granted autonomy in 1967. The economy is closely tied to the larger
  and more populous US Virgin Islands to the west; the US dollar is
  the legal currency.

Brunei
  The Sultanate of Brunei's influence peaked between the 15th
  and 17th centuries when its control extended over coastal areas of
  northwest Borneo and the southern Philippines. Brunei subsequently
  entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal
  succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In
  1888, Brunei became a British protectorate; independence was
  achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six
  centuries. Brunei benefits from extensive petroleum and natural gas
  fields, the source of one of the highest per capita GDPs in Asia.

Bulgaria
  The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the
  local Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
  Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with
  the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the
  end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman
  Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of
  Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having
  fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within
  the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in
  1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its
  first multiparty election since World War II and began the
  contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
  market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
  and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Burkina Faso
  Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved
  independence from France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the
  1970s and 1980s were followed by multiparty elections in the early
  1990s. Current President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987
  military coup and has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's
  high population density and limited natural resources result in poor
  economic prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest
  in Cote d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of
  several hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find
  employment in neighboring countries.

Burma
  Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886)
  and incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered
  as a province of India until 1937 when it became a separate,
  self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was
  attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to
  1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and
  later as political kingpin. In September 1988, the military deposed
  NE WIN and established a new ruling junta. Despite multiparty
  legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition
  party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a
  landslide victory, the junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader
  and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under
  house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in
  May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest. She was
  finally released in November 2010. After the ruling junta in August
  2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices, tens of thousands of
  Burmese marched in protest, led by prodemocracy activists and
  Buddhist monks. In late September 2007, the government brutally
  suppressed the protests, killing at least 13 people and arresting
  thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then, the
  regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest
  persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests.
  Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis which official
  estimates claimed left over 80,000 dead and 50,000 injured. Despite
  this tragedy, the junta proceeded with its May constitutional
  referendum, the first vote in Burma since 1990. Parliamentary
  elections held in November 2010, considered flawed by many in the
  international community, saw the junta's Union Solidarity and
  Development Party garnering over 70 percent of the seats. Parliament
  is constitutionally mandated to convene within 90 days of the
  election; the president, two vice presidents, and ministers will be
  selected at that time.

Burundi
  Burundi's first democratically elected president was
  assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office,
  triggering widespread ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi
  factions. More than 200,000 Burundians perished during the conflict
  that spanned almost a dozen years. Hundreds of thousands of
  Burundians were internally displaced or became refugees in
  neighboring countries. An internationally brokered power-sharing
  agreement between the Tutsi-dominated government and the Hutu rebels
  in 2003 paved the way for a transition process that led to an
  integrated defense force, established a new constitution in 2005,
  and elected a majority Hutu government in 2005. The new government,
  led by President Pierre NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered
  ceasefire with the country's last rebel group in September of 2006
  but still faces many challenges.

Cambodia
  Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers,
  descendants of the Angkor Empire that extended over much of
  Southeast Asia and reached its zenith between the 10th and 13th
  centuries. Attacks by the Thai and Cham (from present-day Vietnam)
  weakened the empire, ushering in a long period of decline. The king
  placed the country under French protection in 1863 and it became
  part of French Indochina in 1887. Following Japanese occupation in
  World War II, Cambodia gained full independence from France in 1953.
  In April 1975, after a five-year struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge
  forces captured Phnom Penh and evacuated all cities and towns. At
  least 1.5 million Cambodians died from execution, forced hardships,
  or starvation during the Khmer Rouge regime under POL POT. A
  December 1978 Vietnamese invasion drove the Khmer Rouge into the
  countryside, began a 10-year Vietnamese occupation, and touched off
  almost 13 years of civil war. The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated
  democratic elections and a ceasefire, which was not fully respected
  by the Khmer Rouge. UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore
  some semblance of normalcy under a coalition government. Factional
  fighting in 1997 ended the first coalition government, but a second
  round of national elections in 1998 led to the formation of another
  coalition government and renewed political stability. The remaining
  elements of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the
  surviving Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial
  for crimes against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal
  supported by international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were
  relatively peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between
  contending political parties before a coalition government was
  formed. In October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne
  and his son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him.
  Local elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of
  the pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National
  elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful.

Cameroon
  The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon
  merged in 1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally
  enjoyed stability, which has permitted the development of
  agriculture, roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry.
  Despite slow movement toward democratic reform, political power
  remains firmly in the hands of President Paul BIYA.

Canada
  A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada
  became a self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the
  British crown. Economically and technologically the nation has
  developed in parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across
  an unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of
  meeting public demands for quality improvements in health care and
  education services, as well as responding to the particular concerns
  of predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its
  diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the
  environment.

Cape Verde
  The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by
  the Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a
  trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and
  resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following
  independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with
  Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained
  until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues
  to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments.
  Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused
  significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result,
  Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one.
  Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.

Cayman Islands
  The Cayman Islands were colonized from Jamaica by the
  British during the 18th and 19th centuries and were administered by
  Jamaica after 1863. In 1959, the islands became a territory within
  the Federation of the West Indies. When the Federation dissolved in
  1962, the Cayman Islands chose to remain a British dependency.

Central African Republic
  The former French colony of Ubangi-Shari
  became the Central African Republic upon independence in 1960. After
  three tumultuous decades of misrule - mostly by military governments
  - civilian rule was established in 1993 and lasted for one decade.
  President Ange-Felix PATASSE's civilian government was plagued by
  unrest, and in March 2003 he was deposed in a military coup led by
  General Francois BOZIZE, who established a transitional government.
  Though the government has the tacit support of civil society groups
  and the main parties, a wide field of candidates contested the
  municipal, legislative, and presidential elections held in March and
  May of 2005 in which General BOZIZE was affirmed as president. The
  government still does not fully control the countryside, where
  pockets of lawlessness persist. Unrest in the neighboring nations of
  Chad, Sudan, and the DRC continues to affect stability in the
  Central African Republic as well.

Chad
  Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured
  three decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before
  a semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
  eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed
  presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke
  out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite
  several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In
  2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing
  attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in
  December 2006 and October 2007. Power remains in the hands of an
  ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a
  referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won
  another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns
  continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a
  significant rebel threat in early 2008.

Chile
  Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century,
  northern Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Mapuche
  inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile declared its
  independence in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not
  achieved until 1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile
  defeated Peru and Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It
  was not until the 1880s that the Mapuche Indians were completely
  subjugated. After a series of elected governments, a three-year-old
  Marxist government of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a
  military coup led by Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely
  elected president was installed in 1990. Sound economic policies,
  maintained consistently since the 1980s, have contributed to steady
  growth, reduced poverty rates by over half, and have helped secure
  the country's commitment to democratic and representative
  government. Chile has increasingly assumed regional and
  international leadership roles befitting its status as a stable,
  democratic nation.

China
  For centuries China stood as a leading civilization, outpacing
  the rest of the world in the arts and sciences, but in the 19th and
  early 20th centuries, the country was beset by civil unrest, major
  famines, military defeats, and foreign occupation. After World War
  II, the Communists under MAO Zedong established an autocratic
  socialist system that, while ensuring China's sovereignty, imposed
  strict controls over everyday life and cost the lives of tens of
  millions of people. After 1978, MAO's successor DENG Xiaoping and
  other leaders focused on market-oriented economic development and by
  2000 output had quadrupled. For much of the population, living
  standards have improved dramatically and the room for personal
  choice has expanded, yet political controls remain tight. China
  since the early 1990s has increased its global outreach and
  participation in international organizations.

Christmas Island
  Named in 1643 for the day of its discovery, the
  island was annexed and settlement began by the UK in 1888. Phosphate
  mining began in the 1890s. The UK transferred sovereignty to
  Australia in 1958. Almost two-thirds of the island has been declared
  a national park.

Clipperton Island
  This isolated island was named for John
  CLIPPERTON, a pirate who made it his hideout early in the 18th
  century. Annexed by France in 1855, it was seized by Mexico in 1897.
  Arbitration eventually awarded the island to France, which took
  possession in 1935.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands
  There are 27 coral islands in the group.
  Captain William KEELING discovered the islands in 1609, but they
  remained uninhabited until the 19th century. From the 1820s to 1978,
  members of the CLUNIE-ROSS family controlled the islands and the
  copra produced from local coconuts. Annexed by the UK in 1857, the
  Cocos Islands were transferred to the Australian Government in 1955.
  The population on the two inhabited islands generally is split
  between the ethnic Europeans on West Island and the ethnic Malays on
  Home Island.

Colombia
  Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from
  the collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and
  Venezuela). A four-decade long conflict between government forces
  and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary
  Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade,
  escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or
  popular support necessary to overthrow the government and violence
  has been decreasing since about 2002, but insurgents continue
  attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are
  under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More
  than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006
  and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal
  organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary
  demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members
  include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has
  stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the
  country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative
  departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence
  spilling over their borders. In January 2011, Colombia assumed a
  nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

Comoros
  Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups
  since gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands
  of Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999,
  military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup, and
  helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in
  which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and
  each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002
  presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected
  its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI
  was elected to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's
  de-facto secession from the Union, refusing to step down in favor of
  fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros' other islands held
  legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially
  attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and
  a naval blockade on Anjouan, but in March 2008, AU and Comoran
  soldiers seized the island. The move was generally welcomed by the
  island's inhabitants.

Congo, Democratic Republic of the
  Established as a Belgian colony in
  1908, the Republic of the Congo gained its independence in 1960, but
  its early years were marred by political and social instability.
  Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power and declared himself president in a
  November 1965 coup. He subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU
  Sese Seko - as well as that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU
  retained his position for 32 years through several sham elections,
  as well as through brutal force. Ethnic strife and civil war,
  touched off by a massive inflow of refugees in 1994 from fighting in
  Rwanda and Burundi, led in May 1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU
  regime by a rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by
  Laurent KABILA. He renamed the country the Democratic Republic of
  the Congo (DRC), but in August 1998 his regime was itself challenged
  by a second insurrection again backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops
  from Angola, Chad, Namibia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to
  support KABILA's regime. A cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the
  DRC, Congolese armed rebel groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda,
  and Zimbabwe but sporadic fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was
  assassinated in January 2001 and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named
  head of state. In October 2002, the new president was successful in
  negotiating the withdrawal of Rwandan forces occupying eastern
  Congo; two months later, the Pretoria Accord was signed by all
  remaining warring parties to end the fighting and establish a
  government of national unity. A transitional government was set up
  in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as president and four vice presidents
  represented the former government, former rebel groups, the
  political opposition, and civil society. The transitional government
  held a successful constitutional referendum in December 2005 and
  elections for the presidency, National Assembly, and provincial
  legislatures in 2006. The National Assembly was installed in
  September 2006 and KABILA was inaugurated president in December
  2006. Provincial assemblies were constituted in early 2007, and
  elected governors and national senators in January 2007.

Congo, Republic of the
  Upon independence in 1960, the former French
  region of Middle Congo became the Republic of the Congo. A quarter
  century of experimentation with Marxism was abandoned in 1990 and a
  democratically elected government took office in 1992. A brief civil
  war in 1997 restored former Marxist President Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO,
  and ushered in a period of ethnic and political unrest.
  Southern-based rebel groups agreed to a final peace accord in March
  2003, but the calm is tenuous and refugees continue to present a
  humanitarian crisis. The Republic of Congo was once one of Africa's
  largest petroleum producers, but with declining production it will
  need new offshore oil finds to sustain its oil earnings over the
  long term.

Cook Islands
  Named after Captain COOK, who sighted them in 1770, the
  islands became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900,
  administrative control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965,
  residents chose self-government in free association with New
  Zealand. The emigration of skilled workers to New Zealand and
  government deficits are continuing problems.

Coral Sea Islands
  Scattered over more than three-quarters of a
  million square kilometers of ocean, the Coral Sea Islands were
  declared a territory of Australia in 1969. They are uninhabited
  except for a small meteorological staff on the Willis Islets.
  Automated weather stations, beacons, and a lighthouse occupy many
  other islands and reefs.

Costa Rica
  Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th
  century, initial attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved
  unsuccessful due to a combination of factors, including: disease
  from mosquito-infested swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives,
  and pirate raids. It was not until 1563 that a permanent settlement
  of Cartago was established in the cooler, fertile central highlands.
  The area remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In
  1821, Costa Rica became one of several Central American provinces
  that jointly declared their independence from Spain. Two years later
  it joined the United Provinces of Central America, but this
  federation disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica
  proclaimed its sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th
  century, only two brief periods of violence have marred the
  country's democratic development. Although it still maintains a
  large agricultural sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to
  include strong technology and tourism industries. The standard of
  living is relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.

Cote d'Ivoire
  Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the
  development of cocoa production for export, and foreign investment
  made Cote d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African
  states, but did not protect it from political turmoil. In December
  1999, a military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
  overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged
  elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular
  protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into
  power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military
  launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces
  claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were
  granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the
  auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and
  rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December
  2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the
  civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained
  unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force
  rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political
  Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's
  government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the
  country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from
  South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and
  hold elections. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of
  rebel forces have been problematic as rebels seek to enter the armed
  forces. Citizen identification and voter registration pose election
  difficulties, and balloting planned for November 2009 was postponed
  with no future date set. Several thousand UN troops and several
  hundred French remain in Cote d'Ivoire to help the parties implement
  their commitments and to support the peace process.

Croatia
  The lands that today comprise Croatia were part of the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire until the close of World War I. In 1918, the
  Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as
  Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal
  independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO.
  Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991,
  it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before
  occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under
  UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was
  returned to Croatia in 1998. In April 2009, Croatia joined NATO; it
  is a candidate for eventual EU accession.

Cuba
  The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after
  the European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492
  and following its development as a Spanish colony during the next
  several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to
  work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the
  launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from
  Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence
  movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US
  intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the
  Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established
  Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island
  experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military
  and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in
  1959; his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly
  five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor
  of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution,
  with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and
  Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country faced a
  severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former
  Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba at
  times portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source if
  its difficulties. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade
  rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the southwest border -
  is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard intercepted 982
  individuals attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in fiscal
  year 2009.

Curacao
  Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by
  the Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once
  the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit by the
  abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of
  neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the
  construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered
  Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch
  Caribbean possesions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles,
  part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and
  2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing
  country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status
  became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the
  Netherlands Antilles.

Cyprus
  A former British colony, Cyprus became independent in 1960
  following years of resistance to British rule. Tensions between the
  Greek Cypriot majority and Turkish Cypriot minority came to a head
  in December 1963, when violence broke out in the capital of Nicosia.
  Despite the deployment of UN peacekeepers in 1964, sporadic
  intercommunal violence continued forcing most Turkish Cypriots into
  enclaves throughout the island. In 1974, a Greek
  Government-sponsored attempt to seize control of Cyprus was met by
  military intervention from Turkey, which soon controlled more than a
  third of the island. In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot-occupied area
  declared itself the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ("TRNC"),
  but it is recognized only by Turkey. The election of a new Cypriot
  president in 2008 served as the impetus for the UN to encourage both
  the Turkish and Cypriot Governments to reopen unification
  negotiations. In September 2008, the leaders of the Greek Cypriot
  and Turkish Cypriot communities started negotiations under UN
  auspices aimed at reuniting the divided island. The entire island
  entered the EU on 1 May 2004, although the EU acquis - the body of
  common rights and obligations - applies only to the areas under the
  internationally recognized government, and is suspended in the areas
  administered by Turkish Cypriots. However, individual Turkish
  Cypriots able to document their eligibility for Republic of Cyprus
  citizenship legally enjoy the same rights accorded to other citizens
  of European Union states.

Czech Republic
  Following the First World War, the closely related
  Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to
  form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's
  leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of
  other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the
  Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II,
  a truncated Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of
  influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the
  efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule
  and create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations
  the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the
  collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its
  freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993,
  the country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national
  components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic
  joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in 2004.

Denmark
  Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north
  European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation
  that is participating in the general political and economic
  integration of Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the
  EU) in 1973. However, the country has opted out of certain elements
  of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European
  Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and
  issues concerning certain justice and home affairs.

Dhekelia
  By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment that created
  the independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty
  and jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers -
  Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The larger of these is the Dhekelia Sovereign
  Base Area, which is also referred to as the Eastern Sovereign Base
  Area.

Djibouti
  The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became
  Djibouti in 1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian
  one-party state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999.
  Unrest among the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war
  that ended in 2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord
  between Afar rebels and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999,
  Djibouti's first multi-party presidential elections resulted in the
  election of Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second term
  in 2005. Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the
  mouth of the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment
  location for goods entering and leaving the east African highlands.
  The present leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains
  a significant military presence in the country but also has strong
  ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in
  sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on
  terrorism.

Dominica
  Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be
  colonized by Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the
  native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763,
  which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after
  independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and
  tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia
  CHARLES, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who
  remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still
  living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining
  in the eastern Caribbean.

Dominican Republic
  Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on
  his first voyage in 1492, the island of Hispaniola became a
  springboard for Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and the American
  mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French dominion over the western
  third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of
  the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own
  independence in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for
  22 years; it finally attained independence as the Dominican Republic
  in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish
  Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored
  independence in 1865. A legacy of unsettled, mostly
  non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of
  Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61. Juan BOSCH was elected
  president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In
  1965, the United States led an intervention in the midst of a civil
  war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin
  BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an election to become president. BALAGUER
  maintained a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when
  international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his
  term in 1996. Since then, regular competitive elections have been
  held in which opposition candidates have won the presidency. Former
  President (1996-2000) Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new
  term in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing
  presidents to serve more than one term, and was since reelected to a
  second consecutive term.

Ecuador
  What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire
  until the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish
  colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New
  Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada
  (Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between
  1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When
  Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of
  the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost
  territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border
  war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although
  Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period
  has been marred by political instability. Protests in Quito
  contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four
  democratically elected Presidents. In September 2008, voters
  approved a new constitution; Ecuador's twentieth since gaining
  independence. General elections, under the new constitutional
  framework, were held in April 2009, and voters re-elected President
  Rafael CORREA.

Egypt
  The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood,
  coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and
  west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great
  civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
  of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last
  native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were
  replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who
  introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who
  ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
  Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the
  conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the
  completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important
  world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt.
  Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of
  Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
  Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in
  1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the
  British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High
  Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the
  time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology
  of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab
  world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue
  to overtax resources and stress society. The government has
  struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through
  economic reform and massive investment in communications and
  physical infrastructure.

El Salvador
  El Salvador achieved independence from Spain in 1821 and
  from the Central American Federation in 1839. A 12-year civil war,
  which cost about 75,000 lives, was brought to a close in 1992 when
  the government and leftist rebels signed a treaty that provided for
  military and political reforms.

Equatorial Guinea
  Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968
  after 190 years of Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a
  mainland portion plus five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest
  on the African continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO
  has ruled the country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup.
  Although nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996,
  2002, and 2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004
  legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president
  exerts almost total control over the political system and has
  discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced
  rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil
  reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's
  third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall
  from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government
  revenue in recent years, there have been few improvements in the
  population's living standards.

Eritrea
  The UN awarded Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a
  federation. Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years
  later sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991
  with Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
  overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year
  border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN
  auspices in December 2000. Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping
  operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ)
  on the border with Ethiopia. Eritrea's denial of fuel to the mission
  caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31
  July 2008. An international commission, organized to resolve the
  border dispute, posted its findings in 2002. However, both parties
  have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision. On
  30 November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely
  demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself, leaving
  Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory,
  including the town of Badme. Eritrea accepted the EEBC's "virtual
  demarcation" decision and called on Ethiopia to remove its troops
  from the TSZ that it states is Eritrean territory. Ethiopia has not
  accepted the virtual demarcation decision. In 2009 the UN imposed
  sanctions on Eritrea after accusing it of backing anti-Ethiopian
  Islamist insurgents in Somalia.

Estonia
  After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian
  rule, Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated
  into the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it
  regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
  Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to
  promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It joined
  both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Ethiopia
  Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian
  monarchy maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the
  exception of a short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974,
  a military junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had
  ruled since 1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody
  coups, uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems,
  the regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel
  forces, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front
  (EPRDF). A constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first
  multiparty elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea
  late in the 1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In
  November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission remotely
  demarcated the border by geographical coordinates, but final
  demarcation of the boundary on the ground is currently on hold
  because of Ethiopian objections to an international commission's
  finding requiring it to surrender territory considered sensitive to
  Ethiopia.

European Union
  Following the two devastating World Wars in the first
  half of the 20th century, a number of European leaders in the late
  1940s became convinced that the only way to establish a lasting
  peace was to unite the two chief belligerent nations - France and
  Germany - both economically and politically. In 1950, the French
  Foreign Minister Robert SCHUMAN proposed an eventual union of all
  Europe, the first step of which would be the integration of the coal
  and steel industries of Western Europe. The following year the
  European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was set up when six
  members, Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the
  Netherlands, signed the Treaty of Paris.
  The ECSC was so successful that within a few years the decision was
  made to integrate other parts of the countries' economies. In 1957,
  the Treaties of Rome created the European Economic Community (EEC)
  and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), and the six
  member states undertook to eliminate trade barriers among themselves
  by forming a common market. In 1967, the institutions of all three
  communities were formally merged into the European Community (EC),
  creating a single Commission, a single Council of Ministers, and the
  European Parliament. Members of the European Parliament were
  initially selected by national parliaments, but in 1979 the first
  direct elections were undertaken and they have been held every five
  years since.
  In 1973, the first enlargement of the EC took place with the
  addition of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. The 1980s saw
  further membership expansion with Greece joining in 1981 and Spain
  and Portugal in 1986. The 1992 Treaty of Maastricht laid the basis
  for further forms of cooperation in foreign and defense policy, in
  judicial and internal affairs, and in the creation of an economic
  and monetary union - including a common currency. This further
  integration created the European Union (EU). In 1995, Austria,
  Finland, and Sweden joined the EU, raising the membership total to
  15.
  A new currency, the euro, was launched in world money markets on 1
  January 1999; it became the unit of exchange for all of the EU
  states except the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Denmark. In 2002,
  citizens of the 12 euro-area countries (the European Monetary Union
  or EMU) began using the euro banknotes and coins. Ten new countries
  joined the EU in 2004 - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
  Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia -
  and in 2007 Bulgaria and Romania joined, bringing the current
  membership to 27. In order to ensure that the EU can continue to
  function efficiently with an expanded membership, the Treaty of Nice
  (in force as of 1 February 2003) set forth rules streamlining the
  size and procedures of EU institutions. An effort to establish an EU
  constitution, begun in October 2004, failed to attain unanimous
  ratification. A new effort, undertaken in June 2007, created an
  Intergovernmental Conference to formulate a political agreement -
  initially known as the Reform Treaty but subsequently referred to as
  the Treaty of Lisbon - which would serve as a constitution. Unlike
  the constitution, however, the Treaty of Lisbon sought to amend
  existing treaties rather than replace them. In October 2009, an
  Irish referendum approved the Treaty (overturning a previous
  rejection) and cleared the way for an ultimate unanimous endorsement
  - the Czech Republic signed on soon after. Treaty implementation
  began on 1 December 2009. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default
  on its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU
  and raised the question of whether a member country might be removed.

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
  Although first sighted by an
  English navigator in 1592, the first landing (English) did not occur
  until almost a century later in 1690, and the first settlement
  (French) was not established until 1764. The colony was turned over
  to Spain two years later and the islands have since been the subject
  of a territorial dispute, first between Britain and Spain, then
  between Britain and Argentina. The UK asserted its claim to the
  islands by establishing a naval garrison there in 1833. Argentina
  invaded the islands on 2 April 1982. The British responded with an
  expeditionary force that landed seven weeks later and after fierce
  fighting forced an Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.

Faroe Islands
  The population of the Faroe Islands is largely
  descended from Viking settlers who arrived in the 9th century. The
  islands have been connected politically to Denmark since the 14th
  century. A high degree of self government was granted the Faroese in
  1948, who have autonomy over most internal affairs while Denmark is
  responsible for justice, defense, and foreign affairs. The Faroe
  Islands are not part of the European Union.

Fiji
  Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a
  British colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military
  coups in 1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as
  dominated by the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers
  brought to the islands by the British in the 19th century). The
  coups and a 1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian
  control of Fiji led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss
  resulted in economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians
  became the majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more
  equitable. Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a
  government led by an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May
  2000 ushered in a prolonged period of political turmoil.
  Parliamentary elections held in August 2001 provided Fiji with a
  democratically elected government led by Prime Minister Laisenia
  QARASE. Re-elected in May 2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006
  military coup led by Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially
  appointed himself acting president but in January 2007 became
  interim prime minister. Since taking power BAINIMARAMA has
  neutralized his opponents, crippled Fiji's democratic institutions,
  and refused to hold elections.

Finland
  Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden
  from the 12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy
  of Russia after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917.
  During World War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom
  and resist invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of
  territory. In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a
  remarkable transformation from a farm/forest economy to a
  diversified modern industrial economy; per capita income is now
  among the highest in Western Europe. A member of the European Union
  since 1995, Finland was the only Nordic state to join the euro
  system at its initiation in January 1999. In the 21st century, the
  key features of Finland's modern welfare state are a high standard
  of education, equality promotion, and national social security
  system; currently challenged by an aging population and the
  fluctuations of an export-driven economy.

France
  Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France
  suffered extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank
  as a dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the
  most modern countries in the world and is a leader among European
  nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid
  presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the
  instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary
  administrations. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation
  with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of
  Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency,
  the euro, in January 1999.

French Polynesia
  The French annexed various Polynesian island groups
  during the 19th century. In September 1995, France stirred up
  widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing on the Mururoa atoll
  after a three-year moratorium. The tests were suspended in January
  1996. In recent years, French Polynesia's autonomy has been
  considerably expanded.

French Southern and Antarctic Lands
  In February 2007, the Iles
  Eparses became an integral part of the French Southern and Antarctic
  Lands (TAAF). The Southern Lands are now divided into five
  administrative districts, two of which are archipelagos, Iles Crozet
  and Iles Kerguelen; the third is a district composed of two volcanic
  islands, Ile Saint-Paul and Ile Amsterdam; the fourth, Iles Eparses,
  consists of five scattered tropical islands around Madagascar. They
  contain no permanent inhabitants and are visited only by researchers
  studying the native fauna, scientists at the various scientific
  stations, fishermen, and military personnel. The fifth district is
  the Antarctic portion, which consists of "Adelie Land," a thin slice
  of the Antarctic continent discovered and claimed by the French in
  1840.
  Ile Amsterdam: Discovered but not named in 1522 by the Spanish, the
  island subsequently received the appellation of Nieuw Amsterdam from
  a Dutchman; it was claimed by France in 1843. A short-lived attempt
  at cattle farming began in 1871. A French meteorological station
  established on the island in 1949 is still in use.
  Ile Saint Paul: Claimed by France since 1893, the island was a
  fishing industry center from 1843 to 1914. In 1928, a spiny lobster
  cannery was established, but when the company went bankrupt in 1931,
  seven workers were abandoned. Only two survived until 1934 when
  rescue finally arrived.
  Iles Crozet: A large archipelago formed from the Crozet Plateau,
  Iles Crozet is divided into two main groups: L'Occidental (the
  West), which includes Ile aux Cochons, Ilots des Apotres, Ile des
  Pingouins, and the reefs Brisants de l'Heroine; and L'Oriental (the
  east), which includes Ile d'Est and Ile de la Possession (the
  largest island of the Crozets). Discovered and claimed by France in
  1772, the islands were used for seal hunting and as a base for
  whaling. Originally administered as a dependency of Madagascar, they
  became part of the TAAF in 1955.
  Iles Kerguelen: This island group, discovered in 1772, is made up of
  one large island (Ile Kerguelen) and about 300 smaller islands. A
  permanent group of 50 to 100 scientists resides at the main base at
  Port-aux-Francais.
  Adelie Land: The only non-insular district of the TAAF is the
  Antarctic claim known as "Adelie Land." The US Government does not
  recognize it as a French dependency.
  Bassas da India: A French possession since 1897, this atoll is a
  volcanic rock surrounded by reefs and is awash at high tide.
  Europa Island: This heavily wooded island has been a French
  possession since 1897; it is the site of a small military garrison
  that staffs a weather station.
  Glorioso Islands: A French possession since 1892, the Glorioso
  Islands are composed of two lushly vegetated coral islands (Ile
  Glorieuse and Ile du Lys) and three rock islets. A military garrison
  operates a weather and radio station on Ile Glorieuse.
  Juan de Nova Island: Named after a famous 15th century Spanish
  navigator and explorer, the island has been a French possession
  since 1897. It has been exploited for its guano and phosphate.
  Presently a small military garrison oversees a meteorological
  station.
  Tromelin Island: First explored by the French in 1776, the island
  came under the jurisdiction of Reunion in 1814. At present, it
  serves as a sea turtle sanctuary and is the site of an important
  meteorological station.

Gabon
  Until recently, only two autocratic presidents had ruled Gabon
  since its independence from France in 1960. The recent president of
  Gabon, El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads
  of state in the world - had dominated the country's political scene
  for four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty
  system and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However,
  allegations of electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and
  the presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal
  political structures in Gabon. President BONGO died in June 2009.
  New elections in August 2009 brought Ali Ben BONGO, son of the
  former president, to power. Despite political conditions, a small
  population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign
  support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable
  African countries. In January 2010, Gabon assumed a nonpermanent
  seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.

Gambia, The
  The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.
  Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived
  federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two
  nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions
  have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya A. J. J. JAMMEH led
  a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned
  political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in
  1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
  nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president
  in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2006.

Gaza Strip
  The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles
  on Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional
  period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
  Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September
  1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security
  and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the
  permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following
  the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the
  Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final
  settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the
  two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic
  Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late
  2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month
  later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments
  in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,
  Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and
  dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew
  settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank
  settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,
  and most access to the Gaza Strip; and it enforces a restricted zone
  along the border inside Gaza. In January 2006, the Islamic
  Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian
  Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government
  in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating
  with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the
  international community so as to lift economic sanctions on
  Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in
  the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous
  Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS
  Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi
  Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National
  Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.
  However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,
  HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and
  governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG
  and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government
  in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the
  NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered
  reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge
  their differences. Late November 2007 through June 2008 witnessed a
  substantial increase in Israeli-Palestinian violence. An
  Egyptian-brokered truce in June 2008 between Israel and HAMAS
  brought about a five-month pause in hostilities, but spiraling
  end-of-year violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1,100 to
  1,400 Palestinians and left tens of thousands of people homeless.
  International donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the Gaza
  Strip, but by the end of 2010 large-scale reconstruction had not
  begun.

Georgia
  The region of present day Georgia contained the ancient
  kingdoms of Colchis and Kartli-Iberia. The area came under Roman
  influence in the first centuries A.D. and Christianity became the
  state religion in the 330s. Domination by Persians, Arabs, and Turks
  was followed by a Georgian golden age (11th-13th centuries) that was
  cut short by the Mongol invasion of 1236. Subsequently, the Ottoman
  and Persian empires competed for influence in the region. Georgia
  was absorbed into the Russian Empire in the 19th century.
  Independent for three years (1918-1921) following the Russian
  revolution, it was forcibly incorporated into the USSR until the
  Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. An attempt by the incumbent Georgian
  government to manipulate national legislative elections in November
  2003 touched off widespread protests that led to the resignation of
  Eduard SHEVARDNADZE, president since 1995. New elections in early
  2004 swept Mikheil SAAKASHVILI into power along with his National
  Movement party. Progress on market reforms and democratization has
  been made in the years since independence, but this progress has
  been complicated by Russian assistance and support to the breakaway
  regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. After a series of Russian and
  separatist provocations in summer 2008, Georgian military action in
  South Ossetia in early August led to a Russian military response
  that not only occupied the breakaway areas, but large portions of
  Georgia proper as well. Russian troops pulled back from most
  occupied Georgian territory, but in late August 2008 Russia
  unilaterally recognized the independence of Abkhazia and South
  Ossetia. This action was strongly condemned by most of the world's
  nations and international organizations.

Germany
  As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation
  (after Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic,
  political, and defense organizations. European power struggles
  immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of
  the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious
  Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945.
  With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in
  1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern
  German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself
  in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which
  became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front
  line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the
  end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since
  then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern
  productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999,
  Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European
  exchange currency, the euro. In January 2011, Germany assumed a
  nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

Ghana
  Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast
  and the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first
  sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.
  Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took
  power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new
  constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won
  presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally
  prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR
  succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS took over
  as head of state in early 2009.

Gibraltar
  Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded
  to Great Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British
  garrison was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum
  held in 1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
  dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK
  led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication
  links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997
  and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.
  In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a
  referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted
  overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since
  late 2004, tripartite talks among Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have
  been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that
  affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation
  agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services;
  communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs
  services; environmental protection; and education and visa services.
  Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial
  waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent
  maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new
  noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European
  Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its
  own tax regime in December 2008, but the UK retains responsibility
  for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial
  stability.

Greece
  Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1829.
  During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the
  20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and
  territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II,
  Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied
  by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war
  between supporters of the king and other anti-Communists and
  Communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece
  joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized
  power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many
  political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In
  1974, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary
  republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC
  (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and
  Monetary Union in 2001. In 2010, the prospect of a Greek default on
  its euro-denominated debt created severe strains within the EMU and
  raised the question of whether a member country might voluntarily
  leave the common currency or be removed.

Greenland
  Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice
  capped. Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland;
  Danish colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was
  made an integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European
  Community (now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985
  over a dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was
  granted self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law
  went into effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of
  increased self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater
  responsibility for internal affairs in June 2009. Denmark, however,
  continues to exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs,
  security, and financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Home
  Rule Government.

Grenada
  Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the
  island in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century.
  The French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar
  estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took
  the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the
  19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export
  crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In
  1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full
  independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest
  independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized
  by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the
  island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean
  nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds
  of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following
  year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck
  Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.

Guam
  Guam was ceded to the US by Spain in 1898. Captured by the
  Japanese in 1941, it was retaken by the US three years later. The
  military installation on the island is one of the most strategically
  important US bases in the Pacific.

Guatemala
  The Mayan civilization flourished in Guatemala and
  surrounding regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost
  three centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence
  in 1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced
  a variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year
  guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement
  formally ending the conflict, which had left more than 100,000
  people dead and had created, by some estimates, some 1 million
  refugees.

Guernsey
  Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last
  remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy, which held sway in
  both France and England. The islands were the only British soil
  occupied by German troops in World War II. Guernsey is a British
  crown dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.
  However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its
  defense and international representation.

Guinea
  Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since gaining
  its independence from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in
  1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the
  first president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic
  elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military
  government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was
  reelected in 1998 and again in 2003, though all the polls were
  marred by irregularities. History repeated itself in December 2008
  when following President CONTE's death, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA
  led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution.
  His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to
  step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in
  September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition
  rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when
  CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and evacuated to
  Morocco and subsequently to Burkina Faso. A transitional government
  led by General Sekouba KONATE held democratic elections in 2010 and
  Alpha CONDE was elected president in the country's first free and
  fair elections since independence.

Guinea-Bissau
  Since independence from Portugal in 1974,
  Guinea-Bissau has experienced considerable political and military
  upheaval. In 1980, a military coup established authoritarian
  dictator Joao Bernardo 'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a
  path to a market economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was
  characterized by the suppression of political opposition and the
  purging of political rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s
  and early 1990s failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected
  president in the country's first free elections. A military mutiny
  and resulting civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in
  May 1999. In February 2000, a transitional government turned over
  power to opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president
  in transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in
  office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and
  businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In
  2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to
  pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was
  assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an
  emergency election held in June 2009.

Guyana
  Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana
  had become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to
  black settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured
  servants from India to work the sugar plantations. This
  ethnocultural divide has persisted and has led to turbulent
  politics. Guyana achieved independence from the UK in 1966, and
  since then it has been ruled mostly by socialist-oriented
  governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was elected president in what is
  considered the country's first free and fair election since
  independence. After his death five years later, his wife, Janet
  JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to poor health. Her
  successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001 and again in 2006.

Haiti
  The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of
  Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were
  virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the
  early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola.
  In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island,
  which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and
  sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the
  Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves
  and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th
  century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint
  L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first
  black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country
  in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political
  violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to
  the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE
  in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new
  elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization
  Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays
  prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a
  democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. A
  massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with
  an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
  An estimated 2 million people live within the zone of heavy to
  moderate structural damage. The earthquake is assessed as the worst
  in this region over the last 200 years and massive international
  assistance will be required to help the country recover.

Heard Island and McDonald Islands
  These uninhabited, barren,
  sub-Antarctic islands were transferred from the UK to Australia in
  1947. Populated by large numbers of seal and bird species, the
  islands have been designated a nature preserve.

Holy See (Vatican City)
  Popes in their secular role ruled portions
  of the Italian peninsula for more than a thousand years until the
  mid 19th century, when many of the Papal States were seized by the
  newly united Kingdom of Italy. In 1870, the pope's holdings were
  further circumscribed when Rome itself was annexed. Disputes between
  a series of "prisoner" popes and Italy were resolved in 1929 by
  three Lateran Treaties, which established the independent state of
  Vatican City and granted Roman Catholicism special status in Italy.
  In 1984, a concordat between the Holy See and Italy modified certain
  of the earlier treaty provisions, including the primacy of Roman
  Catholicism as the Italian state religion. Present concerns of the
  Holy See include religious freedom, international development, the
  environment, the Middle East, China, the decline of religion in
  Europe, terrorism, interreligious dialogue and reconciliation, and
  the application of church doctrine in an era of rapid change and
  globalization. About one billion people worldwide profess the
  Catholic faith.

Honduras
  Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras
  became an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades
  of mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came
  to power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
  anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
  and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist
  guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
  which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion
  in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded.

Hong Kong
  Occupied by the UK in 1841, Hong Kong was formally ceded
  by China the following year; various adjacent lands were added later
  in the 19th century. Pursuant to an agreement signed by China and
  the UK on 19 December 1984, Hong Kong became the Hong Kong Special
  Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China on 1
  July 1997. In this agreement, China promised that, under its "one
  country, two systems" formula, China's socialist economic system
  would not be imposed on Hong Kong and that Hong Kong would enjoy a
  high degree of autonomy in all matters except foreign and defense
  affairs for the next 50 years.

Hungary
  Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many
  centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in
  Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot
  Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The
  country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a
  revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met
  with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership
  of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy,
  introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first
  multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It
  joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.

Iceland
  Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish)
  immigrants during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland
  boasts the world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the
  Althing, established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland
  was subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
  volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
  widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
  island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited
  home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence
  attained in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw
  substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing
  industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined
  the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard
  hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008.
  Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world
  standards.

India
  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest,
  flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into
  northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated onto
  the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the
  earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture.
  The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached
  its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age
  ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a
  flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across
  the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th
  centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi
  Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established
  the Mughal Dynasty which ruled India for more than three centuries.
  European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the
  16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the
  dominant political power on the subcontinent. The British Indian
  Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Nonviolent resistance
  to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU,
  eventually brought about independence in 1947. Communal violence led
  to the subcontinent's bloody partition, which resulted in the
  creation of two separate states, India and Pakistan. The two
  countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of
  which in 1971 resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation
  of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 caused Pakistan
  to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008,
  terrorists allegedly originating from Pakistan conducted a series of
  coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. Despite
  pressing problems such as significant overpopulation, environmental
  degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, rapid
  economic development is fueling India's rise on the world stage. In
  January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the UN Security
  Council for the 2011-12 term.

Indian Ocean
  The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's
  five oceans (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger
  than the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean). Four critically important
  access waterways are the Suez Canal (Egypt), Bab el Mandeb
  (Djibouti-Yemen), Strait of Hormuz (Iran-Oman), and Strait of
  Malacca (Indonesia-Malaysia). The decision by the International
  Hydrographic Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth
  ocean, the Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Indian Ocean
  south of 60 degrees south latitude.

Indonesia
  The Dutch began to colonize Indonesia in the early 17th
  century; Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia
  declared its independence after Japan's surrender, but it required
  four years of intermittent negotiations, recurring hostilities, and
  UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty
  in 1949. Free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999
  after decades of repressive rule. Indonesia is now the world's third
  most populous democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state, and
  home to the world's largest Muslim population. Current issues
  include: alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing
  terrorism, consolidating democracy after four decades of
  authoritarianism, implementing economic and financial reforms,
  stemming corruption, holding the military and police accountable for
  human rights violations, addressing climate change, and controlling
  avian influenza. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace
  agreement with armed separatists in Aceh, which led to democratic
  elections in Aceh in December 2006. Indonesia continues to face low
  intensity armed resistance by the separatist Free Papua Movement.

Iran
  Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in
  1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza
  PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces
  established a theocratic system of government with ultimate
  political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred
  to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the
  constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a
  popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations
  have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US
  Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January
  1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq
  that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
  between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987 and 1988.
  Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its
  activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject
  to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of
  its continued involvement in terrorism and its nuclear weapons
  ambitions. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam
  Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles
  (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in
  response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement
  floundered as conservative politicians, through the control of
  unelected institutions, prevented reform measures from being enacted
  and increased repressive measures. Starting with nationwide
  municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections
  in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
  government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
  inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
  controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests
  over allegations of electoral fraud. The UN Security Council has
  passed a number of resolutions (1696 in July 2006, 1737 in December
  2006, 1747 in March 2007, 1803 in March 2008, and 1835 in September
  2008) calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and
  reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and
  responsibilities. Resolutions 1737, 1477, and 1803 subject a number
  of Iranian individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear and
  ballistic missile programs to sanctions. Additionally, several
  Iranian entities are subject to US sanctions under Executive Order
  13382 designations for proliferation activities and EO 13224
  designations for support of terrorism.

Iraq
  Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by
  Britain during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a
  League of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over
  the next dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in
  1932. A "republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series
  of strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM
  Husayn. Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and
  costly eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait
  but was expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War
  of January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN
  Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass
  destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
  inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions
  over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in
  March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces
  remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate through 2009 and under a
  bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security
  and to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. In October 2005,
  Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and,
  pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of
  Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. After the election, Ibrahim
  al-JAFARI was selected as prime minister; he was replaced by Nuri
  al-MALIKI in May 2006. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in
  May 2006, marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional
  government in nearly a half century. On 31 January 2009, Iraq held
  elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the
  three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and
  Kirkuk province. Iraq held a national legislative election in March
  2010, and after nine months of deadlock the CoR approved the new
  government in December.

Ireland
  Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C.
  Invasions by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were
  finally ended when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014.
  English invasions began in the 12th century and set off more than
  seven centuries of Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions
  and harsh repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched
  off several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in
  independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern
  (Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1949, Ireland withdrew
  from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in
  1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of
  Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A
  peace settlement for Northern Ireland is gradually being implemented
  despite some difficulties. In 2006, the Irish and British
  governments developed and began to implement the St. Andrews
  Agreement, building on the Good Friday Agreement approved in 1998.

Isle of Man
  Part of the Norwegian Kingdom of the Hebrides until the
  13th century when it was ceded to Scotland, the isle came under the
  British crown in 1765. Current concerns include reviving the almost
  extinct Manx Gaelic language. Isle of Man is a British crown
  dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.
  However, the UK Government remains constitutionally responsible for
  its defense and international representation.

Israel
  Following World War II, the British withdrew from their
  mandate of Palestine, and the UN partitioned the area into Arab and
  Jewish states, an arrangement rejected by the Arabs. Subsequently,
  the Israelis defeated the Arabs in a series of wars without ending
  the deep tensions between the two sides. The territories Israel
  occupied since the 1967 war are not included in the Israel country
  profile, unless otherwise noted. On 25 April 1982, Israel withdrew
  from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty. In
  keeping with the framework established at the Madrid Conference in
  October 1991, bilateral negotiations were conducted between Israel
  and Palestinian representatives and Syria to achieve a permanent
  settlement. Israel and Palestinian officials signed on 13 September
  1993 a Declaration of Principles (also known as the "Oslo Accords")
  guiding an interim period of Palestinian self-rule. Outstanding
  territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the 26
  October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace. In addition, on 25 May
  2000, Israel withdrew unilaterally from southern Lebanon, which it
  had occupied since 1982. In April 2003, US President BUSH, working
  in conjunction with the EU, UN, and Russia - the "Quartet" - took
  the lead in laying out a roadmap to a final settlement of the
  conflict by 2005, based on reciprocal steps by the two parties
  leading to two states, Israel and a democratic Palestine. However,
  progress toward a permanent status agreement was undermined by
  Israeli-Palestinian violence between September 2003 and February
  2005. In the summer of 2005, Israel unilaterally disengaged from the
  Gaza Strip, evacuating settlers and its military while retaining
  control over most points of entry into the Gaza Strip. The election
  of HAMAS to head the Palestinian Legislative Council froze relations
  between Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). Ehud OLMERT
  became prime minister in March 2006 and presided over a 34-day
  conflict with Hizballah in Lebanon in June-August 2006 and a 23-day
  conflict with HAMAS in the Gaza Strip during December 2008 and
  January 2009. OLMERT, who in June 2007 resumed talks with PA
  President Mahmoud ABBAS, resigned in September 2008. Prime Minister
  Binyamin NETANYAHU formed a coalition in March 2009 following a
  February 2009 general election. Direct talks launched in September
  2010 collapsed following the expiration of Israel's 10-month partial
  settlement construction moratorium in the West Bank. Diplomatic
  initiatives to revive the negotiations through proximity talks began
  at the end of 2010.

Italy
  Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states
  of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under
  King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to
  a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a
  Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's
  defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy
  in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of
  NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the
  forefront of European economic and political unification, joining
  the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include
  illegal immigration, organized crime, corruption, high unemployment,
  sluggish economic growth, and the low incomes and technical
  standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north.

Jamaica
  The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 -
  was settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native
  Taino Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were
  gradually exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England
  seized the island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based
  on sugar, cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed
  a quarter million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica
  gradually obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it
  joined other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of
  the West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew
  from the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions
  during the 1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated
  with the major political parties evolved into powerful organized
  crime networks involved in international drug smuggling and money
  laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose
  significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many
  rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute
  substantially to the economy.

Jan Mayen
  This desolate, arctic, mountainous island was named after
  a Dutch whaling captain who indisputably discovered it in 1614
  (earlier claims are inconclusive). Visited only occasionally by seal
  hunters and trappers over the following centuries, the island came
  under Norwegian sovereignty in 1929. The long dormant Beerenberg
  volcano resumed activity in 1970; the most recent eruption occurred
  in 1985. It is the northernmost active volcano on earth.

Japan
  In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa
  shogunate (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long
  period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign
  influence. For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to
  enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports
  after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began
  to intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and
  early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to
  defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea,
  Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan
  occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of
  China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry
  into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast
  Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an
  economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his
  throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold
  actual decision-making power. Following three decades of
  unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown
  starting in the 1990s, but the country remains a major economic
  power.

Jersey
  Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last
  remnants of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy that held sway in both
  France and England. These islands were the only British soil
  occupied by German troops in World War II. Jersey is a British crown
  dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.
  However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its
  defense and international representation.

Jordan
  Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman
  Empire, the UK received a mandate to govern much of the Middle East.
  Britain separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from
  Palestine in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence
  in 1946; it adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's
  long-time ruler was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he
  successfully navigated competing pressures from the major powers
  (US, USSR, and UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large
  internal Palestinian population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel
  in the 1967 war and barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who
  attempted to overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988
  permanently relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989,
  he reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual
  political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992.
  In 1994, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the
  son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death
  in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and
  undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to
  the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in
  the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003, Jordan
  staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of Saddam in Iraq and
  following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq, absorbed
  thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July
  2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils
  were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held
  in November 2010 and saw independent pro-government candidates win
  the vast majority of seats.

Kazakhstan
  Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes
  who migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united
  as a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th
  century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the
  1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens
  were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures.
  This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other
  deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
  non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 drove
  many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger
  than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the
  country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: developing
  a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the
  country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
  diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors;
  enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness; developing a
  multiparty parliament and advancing political and social reform; and
  strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign
  powers.

Kenya
  Founding president and liberation struggle icon Jomo KENYATTA
  led Kenya from independence in 1963 until his death in 1978, when
  President Daniel Toroitich arap MOI took power in a constitutional
  succession. The country was a de facto one-party state from 1969
  until 1982 when the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) made
  itself the sole legal party in Kenya. MOI acceded to internal and
  external pressure for political liberalization in late 1991. The
  ethnically fractured opposition failed to dislodge KANU from power
  in elections in 1992 and 1997, which were marred by violence and
  fraud, but were viewed as having generally reflected the will of the
  Kenyan people. President MOI stepped down in December 2002 following
  fair and peaceful elections. Mwai KIBAKI, running as the candidate
  of the multiethnic, united opposition group, the National Rainbow
  Coalition (NARC), defeated KANU candidate Uhuru KENYATTA and assumed
  the presidency following a campaign centered on an anticorruption
  platform. KIBAKI's NARC coalition splintered in 2005 over the
  constitutional review process. Government defectors joined with KANU
  to form a new opposition coalition, the Orange Democratic Movement,
  which defeated the government's draft constitution in a popular
  referendum in November 2005. KIBAKI's reelection in December 2007
  brought charges of vote rigging from ODM candidate Raila ODINGA and
  unleashed two months of violence in which as many as 1,500 people
  died. UN-sponsored talks in late February produced a powersharing
  accord bringing ODINGA into the government in the restored position
  of prime minister.

Kiribati
  The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892
  and a colony in 1915; they were captured by the Japanese in the
  Pacific War in 1941. The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites
  of major US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons
  in 1943. The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in
  1971 and complete independence in 1979 under the new name of
  Kiribati. The US relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited
  Phoenix and Line Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with
  Kiribati.

Korea, North
  An independent kingdom for much of its long history,
  Korea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the
  Russo-Japanese War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the
  entire peninsula. Following World War II, Korea was split with the
  northern half coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist control. After
  failing in the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed
  Republic of Korea (ROK) in the southern portion by force, North
  Korea (DPRK), under its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a
  policy of ostensible diplomatic and economic "self-reliance" as a
  check against outside influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the
  ultimate threat to its social system through state-funded
  propaganda, and molded political, economic, and military policies
  around the core ideological objective of eventual unification of
  Korea under Pyongyang's control. KIM's son, the current ruler KIM
  Jong Il, was officially designated as his father's successor in
  1980, assuming a growing political and managerial role until the
  elder KIM's death in 1994. After decades of economic mismanagement
  and resource misallocation, the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied
  heavily on international aid to feed its population. North Korea's
  history of regional military provocations, proliferation of
  military-related items, long-range missile development, WMD programs
  including tests of nuclear devices in 2006 and 2009, and massive
  conventional armed forces are of major concern to the international
  community.

Korea, South
  An independent Korean state or collection of states has
  existed almost continuously for several millennia. Between its
  initial unification in the 7th century - from three predecessor
  Korean states - until the 20th century, Korea existed as a single
  independent country. In 1905, following the Russo-Japanese War,
  Korea became a protectorate of imperial Japan, and in 1910 it was
  annexed as a colony. Korea regained its independence following
  Japan's surrender to the United States in 1945. After World War II,
  a Republic of Korea (ROK) was set up in the southern half of the
  Korean Peninsula while a Communist-style government was installed in
  the north (the DPRK). During the Korean War (1950-53), US troops and
  UN forces fought alongside soldiers from the ROK to defend South
  Korea from DPRK attacks supported by China and the Soviet Union. An
  armistice was signed in 1953, splitting the peninsula along a
  demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Thereafter, South
  Korea achieved rapid economic growth with per capita income rising
  to roughly 17 times the level of North Korea. In 1993, KIM Young-sam
  became South Korea's first civilian president following 32 years of
  military rule. South Korea today is a fully functioning modern
  democracy. President LEE Myung-bak has pursued a policy of global
  engagement since taking office in February 2008, highlighted by
  Seoul's hosting of the G-20 summit in November 2010. Serious
  tensions with North Korea have punctuated inter-Korean relations in
  recent years, including the North's sinking of the South Korean
  warship Cheonan in March 2010 and its artillery attack on South
  Korean soldiers and citizens in November 2010.

Kosovo
  Ethnic Serbs migrated to the territories of modern Kosovo in
  the 7th century but did not fully incorporate them into the Serbian
  realm until the early 13th century. During the medieval period,
  Kosovo became the center of a Serbian Empire and saw the
  construction of many important Serb religious sites, including many
  architecturally significant Serbian Orthodox monasteries. The defeat
  of Serbian forces at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 led to five
  centuries of Ottoman rule during which large numbers of Turks and
  Albanians moved to Kosovo. By the end of the 19th century, Albanians
  replaced the Serbs as the dominant ethnic group in Kosovo. Serbia
  reacquired control over Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire during the
  First Balkan War of 1912. Kosovo became an autonomous province of
  Serbia with status almost equivalent to that of a republic under the
  1974 Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
  Despite legislative concessions, Albanian nationalism increased in
  the 1980s, which led to riots and calls for Kosovo's independence.
  At the same time, Serb nationalist leaders, such as Slobodan
  MILOSEVIC, exploited Kosovo Serb claims of maltreatment to secure
  votes from supporters, many of whom viewed Kosovo as their cultural
  heartland. Under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia instituted a new
  constitution in 1989 that revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous
  province of Serbia. Kosovo Albanian leaders responded in 1991 by
  organizing a referendum that declared Kosovo independent. Under
  MILOSEVIC, Serbia carried out repressive measures against the
  Albanians in the early 1990s as the unofficial Kosovo government,
  led by Ibrahim RUGOVA, used passive resistance in an attempt to try
  to gain international assistance and recognition of an independent
  Kosovo. Albanians dissatisfied with RUGOVA's passive strategy in the
  1990s created the Kosovo Liberation Army and launched an insurgency.
  Starting in 1998, Serbian military, police, and paramilitary forces
  conducted a counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in massacres
  and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians. Approximately 800,000
  Albanians were forced from their homes in Kosovo during this time.
  International attempts to mediate the conflict failed, and
  MILOSEVIC's rejection of a proposed settlement led to a three-month
  NATO military campaign against Serbia beginning in March 1999 that
  forced Serbia to agree to withdraw its military and police forces
  from Kosovo. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999) placed
  Kosovo under a transitional administration, the UN Interim
  Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), pending a determination of
  Kosovo's future status. A UN-led process began in late 2005 to
  determine Kosovo's final status. The negotiations ran in stages
  between 2006 and 2007, but ended without agreement between Belgrade
  and Pristina. On 17 February 2008, the Kosovo Assembly declared
  Kosovo independent. Since then, over sixty countries have recognized
  Kosovo, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and World
  Bank. Serbia continues to reject Kosovo's independence and it
  subsequently sought an advisory opinion from the International Court
  of Justice (ICJ) on the legality under international law of Kosovo's
  independence declaration. In July 2010 the ICJ ruled that Kosovo's
  declaration of independence did not violate international law.

Kuwait
  Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling
  Kuwaiti AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961.
  Kuwait was attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following
  several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a
  ground assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four
  days. Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure
  damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since
  returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature
  that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country
  witnessed the historic election in May 2009 of four women to its
  National Assembly.

Kyrgyzstan
  A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and
  proud nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to
  Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist
  Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population
  was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved
  independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide
  demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of
  President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990.
  Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won
  overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the
  next few years, the new president manipulated the parliament to
  accrue new powers for himself. In July 2009, after months of
  harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won
  re-election in a presidential campaign that the international
  community deemed flawed. In April 2010, nationwide protests led to
  the resignation and expulsion of BAKIEV. He was replaced by
  President Roza OTUNBAEVA who will serve as president until 31
  December 2011 according to a presidential decree issued 19 May 2010.
  Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in October 2011.
  Continuing concerns include: endemic corruption, poor interethnic
  relations, and terrorism.

Laos
  Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan
  Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM. For 300
  years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and
  Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries
  of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam
  (Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century
  when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty
  of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the
  Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a
  six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime
  closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private
  enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began
  in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997. In late 2009,
  Thailand returned to Laos about 3,000 Hmong residing in refugee
  camps.

Latvia
  The name "Latvia" originates from the ancient Latgalians, one
  of four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the
  Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.). The region
  subsequently came under the control of Germans, Poles, Swedes, and
  finally, Russians. A Latvian republic emerged following World War I,
  but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized
  by the US and many other countries. Latvia reestablished its
  independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
  Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the
  Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to
  Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Lebanon
  Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the
  northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The
  French separated out the region of Lebanon in 1920, and granted this
  area independence in 1943. A lengthy civil war (1975-1990)
  devastated the country, but Lebanon has since made progress toward
  rebuilding its political institutions. Under the Ta'if Accord - the
  blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese established a
  more equitable political system, particularly by giving Muslims a
  greater voice in the political process while institutionalizing
  sectarian divisions in the government. Since the end of the war,
  Lebanon has conducted several successful elections. Most militias
  have been reduced or disbanded, with the exception of Hizballah,
  designated by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist
  Organization, and Palestinian militant groups. During Lebanon's
  civil war, the Arab League legitimized in the Ta'if Accord Syria's
  troop deployment, numbering about 16,000 based mainly east of Beirut
  and in the Bekaa Valley. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon
  in May 2000 and the passage in September 2004 of UNSCR 1559 - a
  resolution calling for Syria to withdraw from Lebanon and end its
  interference in Lebanese affairs - encouraged some Lebanese groups
  to demand that Syria withdraw its forces as well. The assassination
  of former Prime Minister Rafiq HARIRI and 22 others in February 2005
  led to massive demonstrations in Beirut against the Syrian presence
  ("the Cedar Revolution"), and Syria withdrew the remainder of its
  military forces in April 2005. In May-June 2005, Lebanon held its
  first legislative elections since the end of the civil war free of
  foreign interference, handing a majority to the bloc led by Sa'ad
  HARIRI, the slain prime minister's son. In July 2006, Hizballah
  kidnapped two Israeli soldiers leading to a 34-day conflict with
  Israel in which approximately 1,200 Lebanese civilians were killed.
  UNSCR 1701 ended the war in August 2006, and Lebanese Armed Forces
  (LAF) deployed throughout the country for the first time in decades,
  charged with securing Lebanon's borders against weapons smuggling
  and maintaining a weapons-free zone in south Lebanon with the help
  of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The LAF in
  May-September 2007 battled Sunni extremist group Fatah al-Islam in
  the Nahr al-Barid Palestinian refugee camp, winning a decisive
  victory, but destroying the camp and displacing 30,000 Palestinian
  residents. Lebanese politicians in November 2007 were unable to
  agree on a successor to Emile LAHUD when he stepped down as
  president, creating a political vacuum until the election of LAF
  Commander Gen. Michel SULAYMAN in May 2008 and the formation of a
  new unity government in July 2008. Legislative elections in June
  2009 again produced victory for the bloc led by Sa'ad HARIRI, but a
  period of prolonged negotiation over the composition of the cabinet
  ensued. A national unity government was finally formed in November
  2009 and approved by the National Assembly the following month. In
  January 2010, Lebanon assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security
  Council for the 2010-11 term.

Lesotho
  Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon
  independence from the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled
  for the first two decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but
  returned to Lesotho in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995.
  Constitutional government was restored in 1993 after seven years of
  military rule. In 1998, violent protests and a military mutiny
  following a contentious election prompted a brief but bloody
  intervention by South African and Botswana military forces under the
  aegis of the Southern African Development Community. Subsequent
  constitutional reforms restored relative political stability.
  Peaceful parliamentary elections were held in 2002, but the National
  Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and
  aggrieved parties continue to dispute how the electoral law was
  applied to award proportional seats in the Assembly.

Liberia
  Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today
  Liberia began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to
  establish a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did
  much to promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic,
  social, and political gaps between the descendents of the original
  settlers and the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military
  coup led by Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In
  December 1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's
  regime that led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was
  killed. A period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections
  that brought TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An
  August 2003 peace agreement ended the war and prompted the
  resignation of former president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes
  charges in The Hague related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's
  civil war. After two years of rule by a transitional government,
  democratic elections in late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON
  SIRLEAF to power. The UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) maintains a
  strong presence throughout the country, but the security situation
  is still fragile and the process of rebuilding the social and
  economic structure of this war-torn country continues.

Libya
  The Italians supplanted the Ottoman Turks in the area around
  Tripoli in 1911 and did not relinquish their hold until 1943 when
  defeated in World War II. Libya then passed to UN administration and
  achieved independence in 1951. Following a 1969 military coup, Col.
  Muammar Abu Minyar al-QADHAFI began to espouse his own political
  system, the Third Universal Theory. The system is a combination of
  socialism and Islam derived in part from tribal practices and is
  supposed to be implemented by the Libyan people themselves in a
  unique form of "direct democracy." QADHAFI has always seen himself
  as a revolutionary and visionary leader. He used oil funds during
  the 1970s and 1980s to promote his ideology outside Libya,
  supporting subversives and terrorists abroad to hasten the end of
  Marxism and capitalism. In addition, beginning in 1973, he engaged
  in military operations in northern Chad's Aozou Strip - to gain
  access to minerals and to use as a base of influence in Chadian
  politics - but was forced to retreat in 1987. UN sanctions in 1992
  isolated QADHAFI politically following the downing of Pan AM Flight
  103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. During the 1990s, QADHAFI began to
  rebuild his relationships with Europe. UN sanctions were suspended
  in April 1999 and finally lifted in September 2003 after Libya
  accepted responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing. In December 2003,
  Libya announced that it had agreed to reveal and end its programs to
  develop weapons of mass destruction and to renounce terrorism.
  QADHAFI has made significant strides in normalizing relations with
  Western nations since then. He has received various Western European
  leaders as well as many working-level and commercial delegations,
  and made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he
  traveled to Brussels in April 2004. The US rescinded Libya's
  designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in June 2006. In January
  2008, Libya assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council
  for the 2008-09 term. In August 2008, the US and Libya signed a
  bilateral comprehensive claims settlement agreement to compensate
  claimants in both countries who allege injury or death at the hands
  of the other country, including the Lockerbie bombing, the LaBelle
  disco bombing, and the UTA 772 bombing. In October 2008, the US
  Government received $1.5 billion pursuant to the agreement to
  distribute to US national claimants, and as a result effectively
  normalized its bilateral relationship with Libya. The two countries
  then exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 1973 in January
  2009. Libya in May 2010 was elected to its first three-year seat on
  the UN Human Rights Council, prompting protests from international
  non-governmental organizations and human rights campaigners.

Liechtenstein
  The Principality of Liechtenstein was established
  within the Holy Roman Empire in 1719. Occupied by both French and
  Russian troops during the Napoleonic wars, it became a sovereign
  state in 1806 and joined the Germanic Confederation in 1815.
  Liechtenstein became fully independent in 1866 when the
  Confederation dissolved. Until the end of World War I, it was
  closely tied to Austria, but the economic devastation caused by that
  conflict forced Liechtenstein to enter into a customs and monetary
  union with Switzerland. Since World War II (in which Liechtenstein
  remained neutral), the country's low taxes have spurred outstanding
  economic growth. In 2000, shortcomings in banking regulatory
  oversight resulted in concerns about the use of financial
  institutions for money laundering. However, Liechtenstein
  implemented anti-money-laundering legislation and a Mutual Legal
  Assistance Treaty with the US that went into effect in 2003.

Lithuania
  Lithuanian lands were united under MINDAUGAS in 1236; over
  the next century, through alliances and conquest, Lithuania extended
  its territory to include most of present-day Belarus and Ukraine. By
  the end of the 14th century Lithuania was the largest state in
  Europe. An alliance with Poland in 1386 led the two countries into a
  union through the person of a common ruler. In 1569, Lithuania and
  Poland formally united into a single dual state, the
  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. This entity survived until 1795 when
  its remnants were partitioned by surrounding countries. Lithuania
  regained its independence following World War I but was annexed by
  the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US and many
  other countries. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the
  Soviet republics to declare its independence, but Moscow did not
  recognize this proclamation until September of 1991 (following the
  abortive coup in Moscow). The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993.
  Lithuania subsequently restructured its economy for integration into
  Western European institutions; it joined both NATO and the EU in the
  spring of 2004.

Luxembourg
  Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815
  and an independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than
  half of its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure
  of autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by
  Germany in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it
  entered into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the
  following year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding
  countries of the European Economic Community (later the European
  Union), and in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.

Macau
  Colonized by the Portuguese in the 16th century, Macau was the
  first European settlement in the Far East. Pursuant to an agreement
  signed by China and Portugal on 13 April 1987, Macau became the
  Macau Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic
  of China on 20 December 1999. In this agreement, China promised
  that, under its "one country, two systems" formula, China's
  socialist economic system would not be practiced in Macau, and that
  Macau would enjoy a high degree of autonomy in all matters except
  foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years.

Macedonia
  Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from
  Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece's objection to the new state's use of
  what it considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international
  recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of
  "the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." In 1995, Greece lifted
  a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize
  relations. The United States began referring to Macedonia by its
  constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia, in 2004 and negotiations
  continue between Greece and Macedonia to resolve the name issue.
  Some ethnic Albanians, angered by perceived political and economic
  inequities, launched an insurgency in 2001 that eventually won the
  support of the majority of Macedonia's Albanian population and led
  to the internationally-brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which
  ended the fighting by establishing a set of new laws enhancing the
  rights of minorities. Fully implementing the Framework Agreement and
  stimulating economic growth and development continue to be
  challenges for Macedonia, although progress has been made on both
  fronts over the past several years.

Madagascar
  Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a
  French colony in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. During
  1992-93, free presidential and National Assembly elections were held
  ending 17 years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second
  presidential race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and
  1980s, was returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential
  election was contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and
  Marc RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country.
  In April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA
  the winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a
  landslide victory in the generally free and fair presidential
  elections of 2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing
  restrictions on opposition press and activities resulted in
  RAVALOMANANA stepping down and the presidency was conferred to the
  mayor of Antananarivo, Andry RAJOELINA. Following negotiations in
  July and August of 2009, a power-sharing agreement with a 15-month
  transitional period was established, but has not yet been
  implemented.

Malawi
  Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland
  became the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades
  of one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country
  held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution
  that came into full effect the following year. Current President
  Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by
  the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another
  term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and
  subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party
  (DPP) in 2005. As president, MUTHARIKA has overseen economic
  improvement but because of political deadlock in the legislature,
  his minority party has been unable to pass significant legislation,
  and anti-corruption measures have stalled. Population growth,
  increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the
  spread of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi. MUTHARIKA was
  reelected to a second term in May 2009.

Malaysia
  During the late 18th and 19th centuries, Great Britain
  established colonies and protectorates in the area of current
  Malaysia; these were occupied by Japan from 1942 to 1945. In 1948,
  the British-ruled territories on the Malay Peninsula formed the
  Federation of Malaya, which became independent in 1957. Malaysia was
  formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the
  East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of
  Borneo joined the Federation. The first several years of the
  country's history were marred by a Communist insurgency, Indonesian
  confrontation with Malaysia, Philippine claims to Sabah, and
  Singapore's secession from the Federation in 1965. During the
  22-year term of Prime Minister MAHATHIR bin Mohamad (1981-2003),
  Malaysia was successful in diversifying its economy from dependence
  on exports of raw materials to expansion in manufacturing, services,
  and tourism.

Maldives
  The Maldives was long a sultanate, first under Dutch and
  then under British protection. It became a republic in 1968, three
  years after independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated
  the islands' political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive
  terms by single-party referendums. Following riots in the capital
  Male in August 2004, the president and his government pledged to
  embark upon democratic reforms including a more representative
  political system and expanded political freedoms. Progress was
  sluggish, however, and many promised reforms were slow to be
  realized. Nonetheless, political parties were legalized in 2005. In
  June 2008, a constituent assembly - termed the "Special Majlis" -
  finalized a new constitution, which was ratified by the president in
  August. The first-ever presidential elections under a
  multi-candidate, multi-party system were held in October 2008.
  GAYOOM was defeated in a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a political
  activist who had been jailed several years earlier by the former
  regime. Challenges facing the new president include strengthening
  democracy and combating poverty and drug abuse. Maldives officials
  have been prominent participants in international climate change
  talks due to the islands' low elevation and the threat from
  sea-level rise.

Mali
  The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France
  in 1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a
  few months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed
  Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a
  military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling
  Mali's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the
  continent. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first democratic
  presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997. In keeping
  with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, KONARE stepped down in
  2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE, who was subsequently elected
  to a second term in 2007. The elections were widely judged to be
  free and fair.

Malta
  Great Britain formally acquired possession of Malta in 1814.
  The island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and
  remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A
  decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the
  island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a
  financial center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU
  member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.

Marshall Islands
  After almost four decades under US administration
  as the easternmost part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific
  Islands, the Marshall Islands attained independence in 1986 under a
  Compact of Free Association. Compensation claims continue as a
  result of US nuclear testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and
  1962. The Marshall Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA)
  Reagan Missile Test Site, a key installation in the US missile
  defense network.

Mauritania
  Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the
  southern third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in
  1976 but relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
  guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould
  Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania
  with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of
  presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A
  bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in
  a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule.
  Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in
  April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected
  president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military
  junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and ushered
  in a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected
  president in July 2009. The country continues to experience ethnic
  tensions among its black population (Afro-Mauritanians) and white
  and black Moor (Arab-Berber) communities, and is having to confront
  a growing terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb
  (AQIM).

Mauritius
  Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the
  10th century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the
  16th century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in
  honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French
  assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important
  naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a
  plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in
  1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically
  important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an
  important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy
  operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence.
  Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy
  with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the
  country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned
  one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather,
  declining sugar prices, and declining textile and apparel
  production, have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests
  over standards of living in the Creole community.

Mayotte
  Mayotte was ceded to France along with the other islands of
  the Comoros group in 1843. It was the only island in the archipelago
  that voted in 1974 to retain its link with France and forego
  independence. In March 2009, Mayotte voted overwhelmingly to become
  France's 101st department - and fifth overseas department - a change
  scheduled to become official in 2011.

Mexico
  The site of advanced Amerindian civilizations, Mexico came
  under Spanish rule for three centuries before achieving independence
  early in the 19th century. A devaluation of the peso in late 1994
  threw Mexico into economic turmoil, triggering the worst recession
  in over half a century. The global financial crisis beginning in
  late 2008 caused another massive economic downturn the following
  year. As the economy recovers, ongoing economic and social concerns
  include low real wages, underemployment for a large segment of the
  population, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement
  opportunities for the largely Amerindian population in the
  impoverished southern states. The elections held in 2000 marked the
  first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition
  candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) -
  defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary
  Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate
  Felipe CALDERON. In January 2009, Mexico assumed a nonpermanent seat
  on the UN Security Council for the 2009-10 term.

Micronesia, Federated States of
  In 1979 the Federated States of
  Micronesia, a UN Trust Territory under US administration, adopted a
  constitution. In 1986 independence was attained under a Compact of
  Free Association with the US, which was amended and renewed in 2004.
  Present concerns include large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and
  overdependence on US aid.

Moldova
  Part of Romania during the interwar period, Moldova was
  incorporated into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II.
  Although the country has been independent from the USSR since 1991,
  Russian forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the
  Dniester River supporting the Slavic majority population, mostly
  Ukrainians and Russians, who have proclaimed a "Transnistria"
  republic. One of the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the
  first former Soviet state to elect a Communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as
  its president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until
  he resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a
  narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist
  Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of
  parliamentary votes required to elect a president. Moldova's four
  opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European
  Integration (AEI), which acted as Moldova's governing coalition
  until parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and a new
  governing coalition could be formed. Moldova experienced significant
  political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010, holding three general
  elections (in April 2009, July 2009, and November 2010) and four
  presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a
  president.

Monaco
  The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day
  Monaco in 1215. The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized
  temporary control in 1297, and again in 1331, but were not able to
  permanently secure their holding until 1419. Economic development
  was spurred in the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to
  France and the opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's
  mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made
  Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.

Mongolia
  The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under
  Chinggis KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through
  conquest. After his death the empire was divided into several
  powerful Mongol states, but these broke apart in the 14th century.
  The Mongols eventually retired to their original steppe homelands
  and in the late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won
  its independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime
  was installed in 1924. The modern country of Mongolia, however,
  represents only part of the Mongols' historical homeland; more
  ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
  the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia. Following a
  peaceful democratic revolution, the ex-Communist Mongolian People's
  Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992, but was
  defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996
  parliamentary election. The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the
  2000 parliamentary election, but the party lost seats in the 2004
  election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from
  2004-08. The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008
  parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition
  government with the Democratic Party. In 2010 the MPRP voted to
  retake the name of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), a name it
  used in the early 1920s. The prime minister and most cabinet members
  are MPP members.

Montenegro
  The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century
  when the Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of
  Zeta; over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its
  independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th
  centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop
  princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality.
  After World War I, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs,
  Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in
  1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent
  republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the
  latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, first as
  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, in a looser
  union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its
  right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to
  hold a referendum on independence from the state union. The vote for
  severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55% - the threshold set by the EU
  - allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June
  2006.

Montserrat
  English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled
  on Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three
  decades later. The British and French fought for possession of the
  island for most of the 18th century, but it finally was confirmed as
  a British possession in 1783. The island's sugar plantation economy
  was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century.
  Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population
  fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano
  that began on 18 July 1995. Montserrat has endured volcanic activity
  since, with the last eruption occurring in July 2003.

Morocco
  In 788, about a century after the Arab conquest of North
  Africa, successive Moorish dynasties began to rule in Morocco. In
  the 16th century, the Sa'adi monarchy, particularly under Ahmad
  AL-MANSUR (1578-1603), repelled foreign invaders and inaugurated a
  golden age. The Alaouite dynasty, to which the current Moroccan
  royal family belongs, established a sultanate in Morocco beginning
  in the 17th century. In 1860, Spain occupied northern Morocco and
  ushered in a half century of trade rivalry among European powers
  that saw Morocco's sovereignty steadily erode; in 1912, the French
  imposed a protectorate over the country. A protracted independence
  struggle with France ended successfully in 1956. The
  internationalized city of Tangier and most Spanish possessions were
  turned over to the new country that same year. Sultan MOHAMMED V,
  the current monarch's grandfather, organized the new state as a
  constitutional monarchy and in 1957 assumed the title of King.
  Morocco annexed Western Sahara during the late 1970s, but final
  resolution on the status of the territory remains unresolved.
  Gradual political reforms in the 1990s resulted in the establishment
  of a bicameral legislature, which first met in 1997. Under King
  MOHAMMED VI - who in 1999 succeeded his father to the throne - human
  rights have improved. Morocco enjoys a moderately free press, but
  the government occasionally takes action against journalists who
  report on three broad subjects considered to be taboo: the monarchy,
  Islam, and the status of Western Sahara. Despite the continuing
  reforms, ultimate authority remains in the hands of the monarch.

Mozambique
  Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a
  close with independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic
  dependence on South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil
  war hindered the country's development until the mid 1990's. The
  ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party
  formally abandoned Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the
  following year provided for multiparty elections and a free market
  economy. A UN-negotiated peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel
  Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in
  1992. In December 2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition
  as Joaquim CHISSANO stepped down after 18 years in office. His
  elected successor, Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the
  sound economic policies that have encouraged foreign investment.

Namibia
  South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa
  during World War I and administered it as a mandate until after
  World War II, when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist
  South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group
  launched a war of independence for the area that became Namibia, but
  it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its
  administration in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire
  region. Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since the country won
  independence in 1990. Hifikepunye POHAMBA was elected president in
  November 2004 in a landslide victory replacing Sam NUJOMA who led
  the country during its first 14 years of self rule. POHAMBA was
  reelected in November 2009.

Nauru
  The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their
  language does not resemble any other in the Pacific. The island was
  annexed by Germany in 1888. Its phosphate deposits began to be mined
  early in the 20th century by a German-British consortium. Nauru was
  occupied by Australian forces in World War I and subsequently became
  a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a
  brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It
  achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the
  world's smallest independent republic.

Navassa Island
  This uninhabited island was claimed by the US in 1857
  for its guano. Mining took place between 1865 and 1898. The
  lighthouse, built in 1917, was shut down in 1996 and administration
  of Navassa Island transferred from the Coast Guard to the Department
  of the Interior. A 1998 scientific expedition to the island
  described it as a unique preserve of Caribbean biodiversity; the
  following year it became a National Wildlife Refuge and annual
  scientific expeditions have continued.

Nepal
  In 1951, the Nepalese monarch ended the century-old system of
  rule by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of
  government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy
  within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led
  by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil
  war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the
  dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute
  power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were
  followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists
  and government officials, and culminated in a November 2006 peace
  accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a
  nation-wide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent
  Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished
  the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The
  Constituent Assembly elected the country's first president in July.
  The Maoists, who received a plurality of votes in the Constituent
  Assembly election, formed a coalition government in August 2008, but
  resigned in May 2009 after the president overruled a decision to
  fire the chief of the army staff. The Communist Party of
  Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist and the Nepali Congress party then
  formed a new coalition government with several smaller parties. In
  June 2010, the prime minister resigned but, as of December 2010,
  continued to lead a caretaker government while the parties debate
  who should lead the next government. Disagreements among the
  political parties over issues such as the future of former Maoist
  combatants has hindered the drafting of a new constitution -- due in
  May 2011 -- and the formal conclusion of the peace process.

Netherlands
  The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence
  from Spain in 1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading
  seafaring and commercial power, with settlements and colonies around
  the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the
  Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a
  separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I,
  but suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A
  modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large
  exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member
  of NATO and the EEC (now the EU), and participated in the
  introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former
  Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -
  Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in
  the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint
  Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent
  countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

New Caledonia
  Settled by both Britain and France during the first
  half of the 19th century, the island was made a French possession in
  1853. It served as a penal colony for four decades after 1864.
  Agitation for independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in
  the 1998 Noumea Accord, which over a period of 15 to 20 years will
  transfer an increasing amount of governing responsibility from
  France to New Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to
  conduct a referendum between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New
  Caledonia should assume full sovereignty and independence.

New Zealand
  The Polynesian Maori reached New Zealand in about A.D.
  800. In 1840, their chieftains entered into a compact with Britain,
  the Treaty of Waitangi, in which they ceded sovereignty to Queen
  Victoria while retaining territorial rights. In that same year, the
  British began the first organized colonial settlement. A series of
  land wars between 1843 and 1872 ended with the defeat of the native
  peoples. The British colony of New Zealand became an independent
  dominion in 1907 and supported the UK militarily in both World Wars.
  New Zealand's full participation in a number of defense alliances
  lapsed by the 1980s. In recent years, the government has sought to
  address longstanding Maori grievances.

Nicaragua
  The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish
  colony from Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from
  Spain was declared in 1821 and the country became an independent
  republic in 1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first
  half of the 19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region
  in subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental
  manipulation and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and
  resulted in a short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist
  Sandinista guerrillas to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist
  rebels in El Salvador caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista
  contra guerrillas through much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990,
  1996, and 2001, saw the Sandinistas defeated, but voting in 2006
  announced the return of former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA
  Saavedra. The 2008 municipal elections were characterized by
  widespread irregularities. Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy -
  hard hit by the earlier civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 -
  are slowly being rebuilt, but democratic institutions face new
  challenges under the ORTEGA administration.

Niger
  Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced
  single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was
  forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which
  resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting
  brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by
  Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by
  military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections
  that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year.
  TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a
  constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as
  president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA,
  immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet,
  and promised that elections would be held following a transitional
  period of unspecified duration. Niger is one of the poorest
  countries in the world with minimal government services and
  insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely
  agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by
  extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A
  predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007, the
  Nigerien Movement for Justice (MNJ), and attacked several military
  targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008.
  Successful government offensives in 2009 limited the rebels'
  operational capabilities.

Nigeria
  British influence and control over what would become Nigeria
  and Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A
  series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater
  autonomy; independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of
  military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a
  peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The
  government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a
  petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through
  corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In
  addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and
  religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential
  elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence,
  Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian
  rule since independence. The general elections of April 2007 marked
  the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's
  history. In January 2010, Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the
  UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.

Niue
  Niue's remoteness, as well as cultural and linguistic
  differences between its Polynesian inhabitants and those of the rest
  of the Cook Islands, have caused it to be separately administered.
  The population of the island continues to drop (from a peak of 5,200
  in 1966 to an estimated 1,398 in 2009) with substantial emigration
  to New Zealand 2,400 km to the southwest.

Norfolk Island
  Two British attempts at establishing the island as a
  penal colony (1788-1814 and 1825-55) were ultimately abandoned. In
  1856, the island was resettled by Pitcairn Islanders, descendants of
  the Bounty mutineers and their Tahitian companions.

Northern Mariana Islands
  Under US administration as part of the UN
  Trust Territory of the Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana
  Islands decided in the 1970s not to seek independence but instead to
  forge closer links with the US. Negotiations for territorial status
  began in 1972. A covenant to establish a commonwealth in political
  union with the US was approved in 1975, and came into force on 24
  March 1976. A new government and constitution went into effect in
  1978.

Norway
  Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off
  following the adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in
  994. Conversion of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next
  several decades. In 1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with
  Denmark that lasted more than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians
  resisted the cession of their country to Sweden and adopted a new
  constitution. Sweden then invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway
  keep its constitution in return for accepting the union under a
  Swedish king. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to
  a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway
  remained neutral in World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its
  shipping. Norway proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World
  War II, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany
  (1940-45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a
  member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the
  late 1960s boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current focus is
  on containing spending on the extensive welfare system and planning
  for the time when petroleum reserves are depleted. In referenda held
  in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.

Oman
  The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on
  Indian Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established
  sultanate in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship
  treaties with Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British
  political and military advisors increased, but it never became a
  British colony. In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew the
  restrictive rule of his father; he has ruled as sultan ever since.
  His extensive modernization program has opened the country to the
  outside world while preserving the longstanding close ties with the
  UK. Oman's moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to
  maintain good relations with all Middle Eastern countries.

Pacific Ocean
  The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the world's five
  oceans (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern
  Ocean, and Arctic Ocean). Strategically important access waterways
  include the La Perouse, Tsugaru, Tsushima, Taiwan, Singapore, and
  Torres Straits. The decision by the International Hydrographic
  Organization in the spring of 2000 to delimit a fifth ocean, the
  Southern Ocean, removed the portion of the Pacific Ocean south of 60
  degrees south.

Pakistan
  The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the
  world and dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what
  is presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants
  of this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The
  area underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the
  Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and
  Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries;
  the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The
  separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of
  Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was
  never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two
  wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A
  third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India
  capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani
  politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of
  Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan
  conducted its own tests in 1998. India-Pakistan relations have been
  rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, but both countries are
  taking small steps to put relations back on track. In February 2008,
  Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008, after
  the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF, elected Asif Ali
  ZARDARI to the presidency. Pakistani government and military leaders
  are struggling to control domestic insurgents, many of whom are
  located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan.

Palau
  After three decades as part of the UN Trust Territory of the
  Pacific under US administration, this westernmost cluster of the
  Caroline Islands opted for independence in 1978 rather than join the
  Federated States of Micronesia. A Compact of Free Association with
  the US was approved in 1986 but not ratified until 1993. It entered
  into force the following year when the islands gained independence.

Panama
  Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century,
  Panama broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia,
  Ecuador, and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When
  the latter dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With
  US backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed
  a treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US
  sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure
  (the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army
  Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was
  signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama
  by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and
  increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the
  subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was
  deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the
  Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by
  the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious
  plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The
  project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity,
  is expected to be completed in 2014-15.

Papua New Guinea
  The eastern half of the island of New Guinea -
  second largest in the world - was divided between Germany (north)
  and the UK (south) in 1885. The latter area was transferred to
  Australia in 1902, which occupied the northern portion during World
  War I and continued to administer the combined areas until
  independence in 1975. A nine-year secessionist revolt on the island
  of Bougainville ended in 1997 after claiming some 20,000 lives.

Paracel Islands
  The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive
  fishing grounds and by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932,
  French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on
  Pattle Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam.
  China has occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops
  seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands.
  China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield
  and artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and
  Vietnam.

Paraguay
  Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811. In
  the disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70) - between
  Paraguay and Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost
  two-thirds of all adult males and much of its territory. The country
  stagnated economically for the next half century. Following the
  Chaco War of 1932-35 with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of
  the Chaco lowland region. The 35-year military dictatorship of
  Alfredo STROESSNER ended in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in
  political infighting in recent years, Paraguay has held relatively
  free and regular presidential elections since then.

Peru
  Ancient Peru was the seat of several prominent Andean
  civilizations, most notably that of the Incas whose empire was
  captured by the Spanish conquistadors in 1533. Peruvian independence
  was declared in 1821, and remaining Spanish forces defeated in 1824.
  After a dozen years of military rule, Peru returned to democratic
  leadership in 1980, but experienced economic problems and the growth
  of a violent insurgency. President Alberto FUJIMORI's election in
  1990 ushered in a decade that saw a dramatic turnaround in the
  economy and significant progress in curtailing guerrilla activity.
  Nevertheless, the president's increasing reliance on authoritarian
  measures and an economic slump in the late 1990s generated mounting
  dissatisfaction with his regime, which led to his ouster in 2000. A
  caretaker government oversaw new elections in the spring of 2001,
  which ushered in Alejandro TOLEDO Manrique as the new head of
  government - Peru's first democratically elected president of Native
  American ethnicity. The presidential election of 2006 saw the return
  of Alan GARCIA Perez who, after a disappointing presidential term
  from 1985 to 1990, has overseen a robust macroeconomic performance.

Philippines
  The Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during
  the 16th century; they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the
  Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a
  self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and
  was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a
  10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese
  occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought
  together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the
  Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 20-year
  rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a "people power"
  movement in Manila ("EDSA 1") forced him into exile and installed
  Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several
  coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability
  and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992.
  His administration was marked by increased stability and by progress
  on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases
  on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998. He was
  succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January
  2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges
  broke down and another "people power" movement ("EDSA 2") demanded
  his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as
  president in May 2004. Her presidency was marred by several
  corruption allegations but the Philippine economy was one of the few
  to avoid contraction following the 2008 global financial crisis,
  expanding each year of her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was
  elected to a six-year term as president in May 2010. The Philippine
  Government faces threats from several groups on the US Government's
  Foreign Terrorist Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long
  struggle against ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern
  Philippines, which has led to a peace accord with the Moro National
  Liberation Front and on-again/off-again peace talks with the Moro
  Islamic Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New
  Peoples' Army insurgency also operates through much of the country.

Pitcairn Islands
  Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the
  British and settled in 1790 by the Bounty mutineers and their
  Tahitian companions. Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become
  a British colony (in 1838) and today remains the last vestige of
  that empire in the South Pacific. Outmigration, primarily to New
  Zealand, has thinned the population from a peak of 233 in 1937 to
  less than 50 today.

Poland
  Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the
  middle of the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th
  century. During the following century, the strengthening of the
  gentry and internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of
  agreements between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria
  partitioned Poland amongst themselves. Poland regained its
  independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet
  Union in World War II. It became a Soviet satellite state following
  the war, but its government was comparatively tolerant and
  progressive. Labor turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the
  independent trade union "Solidarity" that over time became a
  political force and by 1990 had swept parliamentary elections and
  the presidency. A "shock therapy" program during the early 1990s
  enabled the country to transform its economy into one of the most
  robust in Central Europe, but Poland still faces the lingering
  challenges of high unemployment, underdeveloped and dilapidated
  infrastructure, and a poor rural underclass. Solidarity suffered a
  major defeat in the 2001 parliamentary elections when it failed to
  elect a single deputy to the lower house of Parliament, and the new
  leaders of the Solidarity Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce
  the Trade Union's political role. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the
  European Union in 2004. With its transformation to a democratic,
  market-oriented country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly
  active member of Euro-Atlantic organizations.

Portugal
  Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the
  15th and 16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status
  with the destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation
  during the Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of its wealthiest
  colony of Brazil in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy;
  for most of the next six decades, repressive governments ran the
  country. In 1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad
  democratic reforms. The following year, Portugal granted
  independence to all of its African colonies. Portugal is a founding
  member of NATO and entered the EC (now the EU) in 1986. In January
  2011, Portugal assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security
  Council for the 2011-12 term.

Puerto Rico
  Populated for centuries by aboriginal peoples, the
  island was claimed by the Spanish Crown in 1493 following COLUMBUS'
  second voyage to the Americas. In 1898, after 400 years of colonial
  rule that saw the indigenous population nearly exterminated and
  African slave labor introduced, Puerto Rico was ceded to the US as a
  result of the Spanish-American War. Puerto Ricans were granted US
  citizenship in 1917. Popularly-elected governors have served since
  1948. In 1952, a constitution was enacted providing for internal
  self government. In plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998, voters
  chose not to alter the existing political status.

Qatar
  Ruled by the Al Thani family since the mid-1800s, Qatar
  transformed itself from a poor British protectorate noted mainly for
  pearling into an independent state with significant oil and natural
  gas revenues. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Qatari
  economy was crippled by a continuous siphoning off of petroleum
  revenues by the Amir, who had ruled the country since 1972. His son,
  the current Amir HAMAD bin Khalifa Al Thani, overthrew him in a
  bloodless coup in 1995. In 2001, Qatar resolved its longstanding
  border disputes with both Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. As of 2007, oil
  and natural gas revenues had enabled Qatar to attain the
  second-highest per capita income in the world.

Romania
  The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries
  under the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their
  autonomy in 1856; they united in 1859 and a few years later adopted
  the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its
  independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and
  acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the
  conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and
  participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years
  later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The
  post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist
  "people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The
  decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in
  1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive
  and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and
  executed in late 1989. Former Communists dominated the government
  until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania joined NATO in
  2004 and the EU in 2007.

Russia
  Founded in the 12th century, the Principality of Muscovy, was
  able to emerge from over 200 years of Mongol domination (13th-15th
  centuries) and to gradually conquer and absorb surrounding
  principalities. In the early 17th century, a new Romanov Dynasty
  continued this policy of expansion across Siberia to the Pacific.
  Under PETER I (ruled 1682-1725), hegemony was extended to the Baltic
  Sea and the country was renamed the Russian Empire. During the 19th
  century, more territorial acquisitions were made in Europe and Asia.
  Defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 contributed to the
  Revolution of 1905, which resulted in the formation of a parliament
  and other reforms. Repeated devastating defeats of the Russian army
  in World War I led to widespread rioting in the major cities of the
  Russian Empire and to the overthrow in 1917 of the imperial
  household. The Communists under Vladimir LENIN seized power soon
  after and formed the USSR. The brutal rule of Iosif STALIN (1928-53)
  strengthened Communist rule and Russian dominance of the Soviet
  Union at a cost of tens of millions of lives. The Soviet economy and
  society stagnated in the following decades until General Secretary
  Mikhail GORBACHEV (1985-91) introduced glasnost (openness) and
  perestroika (restructuring) in an attempt to modernize Communism,
  but his initiatives inadvertently released forces that by December
  1991 splintered the USSR into Russia and 14 other independent
  republics. Since then, Russia has shifted its post-Soviet democratic
  ambitions in favor of a centralized semi-authoritarian state whose
  legitimacy is buttressed, in part, by carefully managed national
  elections, former President PUTIN's genuine popularity, and the
  prudent management of Russia's windfall energy wealth. Russia has
  severely disabled a Chechen rebel movement, although violence still
  occurs throughout the North Caucasus.

Rwanda
  In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the
  majority ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king.
  Over the next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and
  some 150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The
  children of these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan
  Patriotic Front (RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along
  with several political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic
  tensions, culminating in April 1994 in the genocide of roughly
  800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi rebels defeated the
  Hutu regime and ended the killing in July 1994, but approximately 2
  million Hutu refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to
  neighboring Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then, most
  of the refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand
  remained in the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC;
  the former Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on
  retaking Rwanda, much as the RPF tried in 1990. Rwanda held its
  first local elections in 1999 and its first post-genocide
  presidential and legislative elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009
  staged a joint military operation with the Congolese Army in DRC to
  rout out the Hutu extremist insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa
  restored diplomatic relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth
  in late 2009.

Saint Barthelemy
  Discovered in 1493 by Christopher COLUMBUS who
  named it for his brother Bartolomeo, Saint Barthelemy was first
  settled by the French in 1648. In 1784, the French sold the island
  to Sweden, who renamed the largest town Gustavia, after the Swedish
  King GUSTAV III, and made it a free port; the island prospered as a
  trade and supply center during the colonial wars of the 18th
  century. France repurchased the island in 1878 and placed it under
  the administration of Guadeloupe. Saint Barthelemy retained its free
  port status along with various Swedish appellations such as Swedish
  street and town names, and the three-crown symbol on the coat of
  arms. In 2003, the populace of the island voted to secede from
  Guadeloupe and in 2007, the island became a French overseas
  collectivity.

Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha
  Saint Helena is a
  British Overseas Territory consisting of Saint Helena and Ascension
  Islands, and the island group of Tristan da Cunha.
  Saint Helena: Uninhabited when first discovered by the Portuguese in
  1502, Saint Helena was garrisoned by the British during the 17th
  century. It acquired fame as the place of Napoleon BONAPARTE's exile
  from 1815 until his death in 1821, but its importance as a port of
  call declined after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. During
  the Anglo-Boer War in South Africa, several thousand Boer prisoners
  were confined on the island between 1900 and 1903.
  Ascension Island: This barren and uninhabited island was discovered
  and named by the Portuguese in 1503. The British garrisoned the
  island in 1815 to prevent a rescue of Napoleon from Saint Helena. It
  served as a provisioning station for the Royal Navy's West Africa
  Squadron on anti-slavery patrol. The island remained under Admiralty
  control until 1922, when it became a dependency of Saint Helena.
  During World War II, the UK permitted the US to construct an
  airfield on Ascension in support of trans-Atlantic flights to Africa
  and anti-submarine operations in the South Atlantic. In the 1960s
  the island became an important space tracking station for the US. In
  1982, Ascension was an essential staging area for British forces
  during the Falklands War. It remains a critical refueling point in
  the air-bridge from the UK to the South Atlantic.
  Tristan da Cunha: The island group consists of the islands of
  Tristan da Cunha, Nightingale, Inaccessible, and Gough. Tristan da
  Cunha is named after its Portuguese discoverer (1506); it was
  garrisoned by the British in 1816 to prevent any attempt to rescue
  Napoleon from Saint Helena. Gough and Inaccessible Islands have been
  designated World Heritage Sites. South Africa leases a site for a
  meteorological station on Gough Island.

Saint Kitts and Nevis
  Carib Indians occupied the islands for
  hundreds of years before the British began settlement in 1623. The
  islands became an associated state of the UK with full internal
  autonomy in 1967. The island of Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to
  secede in 1971. Saint Kitts and Nevis achieved independence in 1983.
  In 1998, a vote in Nevis on a referendum to separate from Saint
  Kitts fell short of the two-thirds majority needed. Nevis continues
  in its efforts to separate from Saint Kitts.

Saint Lucia
  The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries,
  was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and
  early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally
  ceded to the UK in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its
  plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island,
  dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was
  granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.

Saint Martin
  Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and
  claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631
  and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the
  island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The
  Spanish finally relinquished Saint Martin to the French and Dutch,
  who divided it amongst themselves in 1648. Friction between the two
  sides caused the border to frequently fluctuate over the next two
  centuries, with the French eventually holding the greater portion of
  the island (about 57%). The cultivation of sugar cane introduced
  slavery to the island in the late 18th century; the practice was not
  abolished until 1848. The island became a free port in 1939; the
  tourism industry was dramatically expanded during the 1970s and
  1980s. In 2003, the populace of Saint Martin voted to secede from
  Guadeloupe and in 2007, the northern portion of the island became a
  French overseas collectivity.

Saint Pierre and Miquelon
  First settled by the French in the early
  17th century, the islands represent the sole remaining vestige of
  France's once vast North American possessions.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
  Resistance by native Caribs
  prevented colonization on Saint Vincent until 1719. Disputed between
  France and the United Kingdom for most of the 18th century, the
  island was ceded to the latter in 1783. Between 1960 and 1962, Saint
  Vincent and the Grenadines was a separate administrative unit of the
  Federation of the West Indies. Autonomy was granted in 1969 and
  independence in 1979.

Samoa
  New Zealand occupied the German protectorate of Western Samoa
  at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It continued to administer
  the islands as a mandate and then as a trust territory until 1962,
  when the islands became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish
  independence in the 20th century. The country dropped the "Western"
  from its name in 1997.

San Marino
  The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See
  and Monaco), San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest
  republic. According to tradition, it was founded by a Christian
  stonemason named Marinus in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is
  aligned with that of Italy; social and political trends in the
  republic also track closely with those of its larger neighbor.

Sao Tome and Principe
  Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late
  15th century, the islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee
  and cocoa in the 19th century - all grown with plantation slave
  labor, a form of which lingered into the 20th century. While
  independence was achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not
  instituted until the late 1980s. The country held its first free
  elections in 1991, but frequent internal wrangling between the
  various political parties precipitated repeated changes in
  leadership and two failed coup attempts in 1995 and 2003. The recent
  discovery of oil in the Gulf of Guinea promises to attract increased
  attention to the small island nation.

Saudi Arabia
  Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and home to
  Islam's two holiest shrines in Mecca and Medina. The king's official
  title is the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. The modern Saudi
  state was founded in 1932 by ABD AL-AZIZ bin Abd al-Rahman Al SAUD
  (Ibn Saud) after a 30-year campaign to unify most of the Arabian
  Peninsula. A male descendent of Ibn Saud, his son ABDALLAH bin Abd
  al-Aziz, rules the country today as required by the country's 1992
  Basic Law. Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Saudi Arabia
  accepted the Kuwaiti royal family and 400,000 refugees while
  allowing Western and Arab troops to deploy on its soil for the
  liberation of Kuwait the following year. The continuing presence of
  foreign troops on Saudi soil after the liberation of Kuwait became a
  source of tension between the royal family and the public until all
  operational US troops left the country in 2003. Major terrorist
  attacks in May and November 2003 spurred a strong on-going campaign
  against domestic terrorism and extremism. King ABDALLAH has
  continued the cautious reform program begun when he was crown
  prince. To promote increased political participation, the government
  held elections nationwide from February through April 2005 for half
  the members of 179 municipal councils. In December 2005, King
  ABDALLAH completed the process by appointing the remaining members
  of the advisory municipal councils. The king instituted an
  Inter-Faith Dialogue initiative in 2008 to encourage religious
  tolerance on a global level; in February 2009, he reshuffled the
  cabinet, which led to more moderates holding ministerial and
  judicial positions, and appointed the first female to the cabinet.
  The country remains a leading producer of oil and natural gas and
  holds more than 20% of the world's proven oil reserves. The
  government continues to pursue economic reform and diversification,
  particularly since Saudi Arabia's accession to the WTO in December
  2005, and promotes foreign investment in the kingdom. A burgeoning
  population, aquifer depletion, and an economy largely dependent on
  petroleum output and prices are all ongoing governmental concerns.

Senegal
  The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were
  merged in 1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation
  in 1960. The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined
  with The Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in
  1982. The envisaged integration of the two countries was never
  carried out, and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of
  Democratic Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level
  separatist insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and
  several peace deals have failed to resolve the conflict.
  Nevertheless, Senegal remains one of the most stable democracies in
  Africa. Senegal was ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until
  current President Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000. He was
  reelected in February 2007 and has amended Senegal's constitution
  over a dozen times to increase executive power and to weaken the
  opposition, part of the President's increasingly autocratic
  governing style. Senegal has a long history of participating in
  international peacekeeping and regional mediation.

Serbia
  The Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes was formed in
  1918; its name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. Various
  paramilitary bands resisted Nazi Germany's occupation and division
  of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945, but fought each other and ethnic
  opponents as much as the invaders. The military and political
  movement headed by Josip "TITO" Broz (Partisans) took full control
  of Yugoslavia when German and Croatian separatist forces were
  defeated in 1945. Although Communist, TITO's new government and his
  successors (he died in 1980) managed to steer their own path between
  the Warsaw Pact nations and the West for the next four and a half
  decades. In 1989, Slobodan MILOSEVIC became president of the
  Republic of Serbia and his ultranationalist calls for Serbian
  domination led to the violent breakup of Yugoslavia along ethnic
  lines. In 1991, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declared
  independence, followed by Bosnia in 1992. The remaining republics of
  Serbia and Montenegro declared a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
  (FRY) in April 1992 and under MILOSEVIC's leadership, Serbia led
  various military campaigns to unite ethnic Serbs in neighboring
  republics into a "Greater Serbia." These actions led to Yugoslavia
  being ousted from the UN in 1992, but Serbia continued its -
  ultimately unsuccessful - campaign until signing the Dayton Peace
  Accords in 1995. MILOSEVIC kept tight control over Serbia and
  eventually became president of the FRY in 1997. In 1998, an ethnic
  Albanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of
  Kosovo provoked a Serbian counterinsurgency campaign that resulted
  in massacres and massive expulsions of ethnic Albanians living in
  Kosovo. The MILOSEVIC government's rejection of a proposed
  international settlement led to NATO's bombing of Serbia in the
  spring of 1999, to the withdrawal of Serbian military and police
  forces from Kosovo in June 1999, and to the stationing of a NATO-led
  force in Kosovo to provide a safe and secure environment for the
  region's ethnic communities. FRY elections in late 2000 led to the
  ouster of MILOSEVIC and the installation of democratic government.
  MILOSEVIC was arrested in 2001 and sent to be tried in The Hague for
  crimes against humanity; he died in March 2006 before the completion
  of his trial. In 2001, the country's suspension from the UN was
  lifted. In 2003, the FRY became Serbia and Montenegro, a loose
  federation of the two republics with a federal level parliament.
  Widespread violence predominantly targeting ethnic Serbs in Kosovo
  in March 2004 caused the international community to open
  negotiations on the future status of Kosovo in January 2006. In May
  2006, Montenegro invoked its right to secede from the federation and
  - following a successful referendum - it declared itself an
  independent nation on 3 June 2006. Two days later, Serbia declared
  that it was the successor state to the union of Serbia and
  Montenegro. A new Serbian constitution was approved in October 2006
  and adopted the following month. In February 2008, after nearly two
  years of inconclusive negotiations, the UN-administered province of
  Kosovo declared itself independent of Serbia - an action Serbia
  refuses to recognize. At Serbia's request, the UN General Assembly
  (UNGA) in October 2008 sought an advisory opinion from the
  International Court of Justice (ICJ) on whether Kosovo's unilateral
  declaration of independence was in accordance with international
  law. In a ruling considered unfavorable to Serbia, the ICJ issued an
  advisory opinion in July 2010 stating that international law did not
  prohibit declarations of independence. In late 2010, Serbia agreed
  to an EU-drafted UNGA Resolution acknowledging the ICJ's decision
  and calling for a new round of talks between Serbia and Kosovo.

Seychelles
  A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for
  the islands ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter.
  Independence came in 1976. Socialist rule was brought to a close
  with a new constitution and free elections in 1993. President
  France-Albert RENE, who had served since 1977, was re-elected in
  2001, but stepped down in 2004. Vice President James MICHEL took
  over the presidency and in July 2006 was elected to a new five-year
  term.

Sierra Leone
  Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil
  war from 1991 to 2002 that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths
  and the displacement of more than 2 million people (about one-third
  of the population). The military, which took over full
  responsibility for security following the departure of UN
  peacekeepers at the end of 2005, is increasingly developing as a
  guarantor of the country's stability. The armed forces remained on
  the sideline during the 2007 presidential election, but still look
  to the UN Integrated Office in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) - a civilian
  UN mission - to support efforts to consolidate peace. The new
  government's priorities include furthering development, creating
  jobs, and stamping out endemic corruption.

Singapore
  Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819.
  It joined the Malaysian Federation in 1963 but separated two years
  later and became independent. Singapore subsequently became one of
  the world's most prosperous countries with strong international
  trading links (its port is one of the world's busiest in terms of
  tonnage handled) and with per capita GDP equal to that of the
  leading nations of Western Europe.

Sint Maarten
  Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and
  claimed for Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631
  and set about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the
  island in 1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The
  Spanish finally relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the
  French and Dutch, who divided it amongst themselves in 1648. The
  establishment of cotton, tobacco, and sugar plantations dramatically
  expanded slavery on the island in the 18th and 19th centuries; the
  practice was not abolished in the Dutch half until 1863. The
  island's economy declined until 1939 when it became a free port; the
  tourism industry was dramatically expanded beginning in the 1950s.
  In 1954, Sint Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions
  became part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the Netherlands
  Antilles. In a 2000 referendum, the citizens of Sint Maarten voted
  to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the
  Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October of
  2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.

Slovakia
  The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close
  of World War I allowed the Slovaks to join the closely related
  Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II,
  Czechoslovakia became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated
  Eastern Europe. Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and
  Czechoslovakia once more became free. The Slovaks and the Czechs
  agreed to separate peacefully on 1 January 1993. Slovakia joined
  both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004 and the euro area on 1
  January 2009.

Slovenia
  The Slovene lands were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire
  until the latter's dissolution at the end of World War I. In 1918,
  the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new
  multinational state, which was named Yugoslavia in 1929. After World
  War II, Slovenia became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, which
  though Communist, distanced itself from Moscow's rule. Dissatisfied
  with the exercise of power by the majority Serbs, the Slovenes
  succeeded in establishing their independence in 1991 after a short
  10-day war. Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and
  a stable democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a
  modern state. Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring
  of 2004; it joined the eurozone in 2007.

Solomon Islands
  The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon
  Islands in the 1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War
  II occurred on this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in
  1976 and independence two years later. Ethnic violence, government
  malfeasance, and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil
  society. In June 2003, then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought
  the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the
  following month, an Australian-led multinational force arrived to
  restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance
  Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has generally been effective
  in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.

Somalia
  Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow
  its protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new
  nation of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre
  ushered in an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the
  persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and
  dissidents. After the regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia
  descended into turmoil, factional fighting, and anarchy. In May
  1991, northern clans declared an independent Republic of Somaliland
  that now includes the administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi
  Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag, and Sool. Although not recognized by any
  government, this entity has maintained a stable existence and
  continues efforts to establish a constitutional democracy, including
  holding municipal, parliamentary, and presidential elections. The
  regions of Bari, Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring
  semi-autonomous state of Puntland, which has been self-governing
  since 1998 but does not aim at independence; it has also made
  strides toward reconstructing a legitimate, representative
  government but has suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its
  border with Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool
  and Sanaag. Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort
  (primarily in the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions,
  but when the UN withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant
  casualties, order still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia
  National Peace Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the
  formation of an interim government, known as the Transitional
  National Government (TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate
  security or governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under
  the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development
  (IGAD), led a subsequent peace process that concluded in October
  2004 with the election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a
  second interim government, known as the Transitional Federal
  Government (TFG) of the Somali Republic. The TFG included a
  275-member parliamentary body, known as the Transitional Federal
  Parliament (TFP). President YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United
  Nations-sponsored talks between the TFG and the opposition Alliance
  for the Re-Liberation of Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In
  January 2009, following the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government,
  Ethiopian military forces, which had entered Somalia in December
  2006 to support the TFG in the face of advances by the opposition
  Islamic Courts Union (ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was
  increased to 550 seats with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil
  society members of parliament. The expanded parliament elected
  Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh Ahmed, the former CIC and ARS chairman as
  president on 31 January 2009, in Djibouti. Subsequently, President
  SHARIF appointed Omar Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE, son of a former
  president of Somalia, as prime minister on 13 February 2009.
  SHARMARKE resigned in September 2010 and was replaced by Mohamed
  Abdullahi MOHAMED, aka Farmajo, a dual US-Somali citizen that lived
  in the United Stated from 1985 until his return to Somalia in
  October 2010. The creation of the TFG was based on the Transitional
  Federal Charter (TFC), which outlines a five-year mandate leading to
  the establishment of a new Somali constitution and a transition to a
  representative government following national elections. However, in
  January 2009 the TFP amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until
  2011.

South Africa
  Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day
  South Africa in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice
  route between the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of
  Cape Town. After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in
  1806, many of the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found
  their own republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold
  (1886) spurred wealth and immigration and intensified the
  subjugation of the native inhabitants. The Boers resisted British
  encroachments but were defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902);
  however, the British and the Afrikaners, as the Boers became known,
  ruled together beginning in 1910 under the Union of South Africa,
  which became a republic in 1961 after a whites-only referendum. In
  1948, the National Party was voted into power and instituted a
  policy of apartheid - the separate development of the races - which
  favored the white minority at the expense of the black majority. The
  African National Congress (ANC) led the opposition to apartheid and
  many top ANC leaders, such as Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South
  Africa's prisons. Internal protests and insurgency, as well as
  boycotts by some Western nations and institutions, led to the
  regime's eventual willingness to negotiate a peaceful transition to
  majority rule. The first multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an
  end to apartheid and ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led
  government. South Africa since then has struggled to address
  apartheid-era imbalances in decent housing, education, and health
  care. ANC infighting, which has grown in recent years, came to a
  head in September 2008 when President Thabo MBEKI resigned, and
  Kgalema MOTLANTHE, the party's General-Secretary, succeeded him as
  interim president. Jacob ZUMA became president after the ANC won
  general elections in April 2009. In January 2011, South Africa
  assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the
  2011-12 term.

South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands
  The islands, which have
  large bird and seal populations, lie approximately 1,000 km east of
  the Falkland Islands and have been under British administration
  since 1908 - except for a brief period in 1982 when Argentina
  occupied them. Grytviken, on South Georgia, was a 19th and early
  20th century whaling station. Famed explorer Ernest SHACKLETON
  stopped there in 1914 en route to his ill-fated attempt to cross
  Antarctica on foot. He returned some 20 months later with a few
  companions in a small boat and arranged a successful rescue for the
  rest of his crew, stranded off the Antarctic Peninsula. He died in
  1922 on a subsequent expedition and is buried in Grytviken. Today,
  the station houses scientists from the British Antarctic Survey.
  Recognizing the importance of preserving the marine stocks in
  adjacent waters, the UK, in 1993, extended the exclusive fishing
  zone from 12 nm to 200 nm around each island.

Southern Ocean
  A large body of recent oceanographic research has
  shown that the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), an ocean current
  that flows from west to east around Antarctica, plays a crucial role
  in global ocean circulation. The region where the cold waters of the
  ACC meet and mingle with the warmer waters of the north defines a
  distinct border - the Antarctic Convergence - which fluctuates with
  the seasons, but which encompasses a discrete body of water and a
  unique ecologic region. The Convergence concentrates nutrients,
  which promotes marine plant life, and which in turn allows for a
  greater abundance of animal life. In the spring of 2000, the
  International Hydrographic Organization decided to delimit the
  waters within the Convergence as a fifth world ocean - the Southern
  Ocean - by combining the southern portions of the Atlantic Ocean,
  Indian Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. The Southern Ocean extends from the
  coast of Antarctica north to 60 degrees south latitude, which
  coincides with the Antarctic Treaty Limit and which approximates the
  extent of the Antarctic Convergence. As such, the Southern Ocean is
  now the fourth largest of the world's five oceans (after the Pacific
  Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean, but larger than the Arctic
  Ocean). It should be noted that inclusion of the Southern Ocean does
  not imply recognition of this feature as one of the world's primary
  oceans by the US Government.

Spain
  Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries
  ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent
  failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused
  the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic
  and political power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II
  but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful
  transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco
  FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the
  EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and
  made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. The
  government continues to battle the Basque Fatherland and Liberty
  (ETA) terrorist organization, but its major focus for the immediate
  future will be on measures to reverse the severe economic recession
  that started in mid-2008.

Spratly Islands
  The Spratly Islands consist of more than 100 small
  islands or reefs. They are surrounded by rich fishing grounds and
  potentially by gas and oil deposits. They are claimed in their
  entirety by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam, while portions are claimed
  by Malaysia and the Philippines. About 45 islands are occupied by
  relatively small numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia,
  the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Brunei has established a
  fishing zone that overlaps a southern reef but has not made any
  formal claim.

Sri Lanka
  The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th
  century B.C. probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced
  in about the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization
  developed at the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C.
  to circa A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In
  the 14th century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom
  in northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were
  controlled by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in
  the 17th century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796,
  became a crown colony in 1802, and was united under British rule by
  1815. As Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed
  to Sri Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and
  Tamil separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of
  fighting, the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
  formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace
  negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces
  intensified in 2006 and the government regained control of the
  Eastern Province in 2007. In May 2009, the government announced that
  its military had finally defeated the remnants of the LTTE and that
  its leader, Velupillai PRABHAKARAN, had been killed.

Sudan
  Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have
  dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956.
  Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the
  remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in
  northern economic, political, and social domination of largely
  non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in
  1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related
  effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and,
  according to rebel estimates, more than two million deaths over a
  period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with
  the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive
  Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern
  rebels autonomy for six years. After which, a referendum for
  independence is scheduled to be held. A separate conflict, which
  broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced
  nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000
  deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation
  from the African Union on 31 December 2007. As of early 2009,
  peacekeeping troops were struggling to stabilize the situation,
  which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought
  instability to eastern Chad. Sudan also has faced large refugee
  influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad.
  Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of
  government support have chronically obstructed the provision of
  humanitarian assistance to affected populations.

Suriname
  First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and
  then settled by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became
  a Dutch colony in 1667. With the abolition of slavery in 1863,
  workers were brought in from India and Java. Independence from the
  Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian
  government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a
  socialist republic. It continued to exert control through a
  succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when
  international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In
  1990, the military overthrew the civilian leadership, but a
  democratically elected government - a four-party coalition -
  returned to power in 1991. The coalition expanded to eight parties
  in 2005 and has continued to rule since.

Svalbard
  First discovered by the Norwegians in the 12th century, the
  islands served as an international whaling base during the 17th and
  18th centuries. Norway's sovereignty was recognized in 1920; five
  years later it officially took over the territory.

Swaziland
  Autonomy for the Swazis of southern Africa was guaranteed
  by the British in the late 19th century; independence was granted in
  1968. Student and labor unrest during the 1990s pressured King
  MSWATI III, the world's last absolute monarch, to grudgingly allow
  political reform and greater democracy, although he has backslid on
  these promises in recent years. A constitution came into effect in
  2006, but political parties remain banned. The African United
  Democratic Party tried unsuccessfully to register as an official
  political party in mid 2006. Talks over the constitution broke down
  between the government and progressive groups in 2007. Swaziland
  recently surpassed Botswana as the country with the world's highest
  known HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.

Sweden
  A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not
  participated in any war for almost two centuries. An armed
  neutrality was preserved in both World Wars. Sweden's
  long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system interlarded
  with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by
  high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic
  downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has
  allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the
  EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in
  a 2003 referendum.

Switzerland
  The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a
  defensive alliance among three cantons. In succeeding years, other
  localities joined the original three. The Swiss Confederation
  secured its independence from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A
  constitution of 1848, subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the
  confederation with a centralized federal government. Switzerland's
  sovereignty and neutrality have long been honored by the major
  European powers, and the country was not involved in either of the
  two World Wars. The political and economic integration of Europe
  over the past half century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN
  and international organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties
  with its neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a
  UN member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and
  international organizations but retains a strong commitment to
  neutrality.

Syria
  Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the
  northern portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The
  French administered the area as Syria until granting it independence
  in 1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and
  experienced a series of military coups during its first decades.
  Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab
  Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the
  Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz
  al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority
  Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political
  stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost
  the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held
  occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of
  President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as
  president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops -
  stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role -
  were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict
  between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on
  alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally
  Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term
  as president.

Taiwan
  In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to
  Japan. Taiwan reverted to Chinese control after World War II.
  Following the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million
  Nationalists fled to Taiwan and established a government using the
  1947 constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five
  decades, the ruling authorities gradually democratized and
  incorporated the local population within the governing structure. In
  2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the
  Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this
  period, the island prospered and became one of East Asia's economic
  "Tigers." The dominant political issues continue to be the
  relationship between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of
  Taiwan's eventual status - as well as domestic political and
  economic reform.

Tajikistan
  The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and
  1870s, but Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the
  Revolution of 1917. Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely
  contested and not fully reestablished until 1925. Much of
  present-day Sughd province was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the
  newly formed Tajik SSR in 1929. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial
  minority in Sughd province. Tajikistan became independent in 1991
  following the breakup of the Soviet Union, and experienced a civil
  war between regional factions from 1992-97. There have been no major
  security incidents in recent years, although the country remains the
  poorest in the former Soviet sphere. Attention by the international
  community since the beginning of the NATO intervention in
  Afghanistan has brought increased economic development and security
  assistance, which could create jobs and strengthen stability in the
  long term. Tajikistan is in the early stages of seeking World Trade
  Organization membership and has joined NATO's Partnership for Peace.

Tanzania
  Shortly after achieving independence from Britain in the
  early 1960s, Tanganyika and Zanzibar merged to form the nation of
  Tanzania in 1964. One-party rule came to an end in 1995 with the
  first democratic elections held in the country since the 1970s.
  Zanzibar's semi-autonomous status and popular opposition have led to
  two contentious elections since 1995, which the ruling party won
  despite international observers' claims of voting irregularities.

Thailand
  A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th
  century. Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast
  Asian country never to have been taken over by a European power. A
  bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In
  alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty
  ally following the conflict. A military coup in September 2006
  ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. The interim government
  held elections in December 2007 that saw the former pro-THAKSIN
  People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition
  government. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD)
  in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government,
  eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August and
  Bangkok's two international airports in November. The PAD ended
  their protests in early December 2008 following a court ruling that
  dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for
  election violations. The Democrat Party then formed a new coalition
  government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister. In October
  2008 THAKSIN went into voluntary exile to avoid imprisonment for a
  corruption conviction, and has since agitated his followers from
  abroad. THAKSIN supporters re-organized into the United Front for
  Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) and rioted in April 2009,
  shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Phuket, and in early 2010
  protested a court verdict confiscating most of THAKSIN's wealth.
  Between March and May 2010, the UDD staged large protests and
  occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok. A government operation
  to disperse the protesters after nine weeks led to clashes that
  resulted in 89 deaths and an estimated $1.5 billion in arson-related
  property losses. These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai
  body politic which continue to hamper the current government. Since
  January 2004, thousands have been killed as separatists in
  Thailand's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the
  violence associated with their cause.

Timor-Leste
  The Portuguese began to trade with the island of Timor
  in the early 16th century and colonized it in mid-century.
  Skirmishing with the Dutch in the region eventually resulted in an
  1859 treaty in which Portugal ceded the western portion of the
  island. Imperial Japan occupied Portuguese Timor from 1942 to 1945,
  but Portugal resumed colonial authority after the Japanese defeat in
  World War II. East Timor declared itself independent from Portugal
  on 28 November 1975 and was invaded and occupied by Indonesian
  forces nine days later. It was incorporated into Indonesia in July
  1976 as the province of Timor Timur (East Timor). An unsuccessful
  campaign of pacification followed over the next two decades, during
  which an estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals lost their lives.
  On 30 August 1999, in a UN-supervised popular referendum, an
  overwhelming majority of the people of Timor-Leste voted for
  independence from Indonesia. Between the referendum and the arrival
  of a multinational peacekeeping force in late September 1999,
  anti-independence Timorese militias - organized and supported by the
  Indonesian military - commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth
  campaign of retribution. The militias killed approximately 1,400
  Timorese and forcibly pushed 300,000 people into western Timor as
  refugees. The majority of the country's infrastructure, including
  homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and
  nearly 100% of the country's electrical grid were destroyed. On 20
  September 1999, the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the
  International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) deployed to the
  country and brought the violence to an end. On 20 May 2002,
  Timor-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state.
  In late April 2006, internal tensions threatened the new nation's
  security when a military strike led to violence and a near breakdown
  of law and order. At Dili's request, an Australian-led International
  Stabilization Force (ISF) deployed to Timor-Leste in late May. In
  August, the UN Security Council established the UN Integrated
  Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which included an authorized police
  presence of over 1,600 personnel. The ISF and UNMIT restored
  stability, allowing for presidential and parliamentary elections in
  April and June 2007 in a largely peaceful atmosphere. In February
  2008, a rebel group staged an unsuccessful attack against the
  president and prime minister. The ringleader was killed in the
  attack and the majority of the rebels surrendered in April 2008.
  Since the unsuccessful attacks the government has enjoyed one of its
  longest periods of post-independence stability.

Togo
  French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA,
  installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand
  for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multiparty elections
  instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated
  by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party
  has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a
  majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in
  February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure
  GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months
  later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first
  relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007.
  After years of political unrest and condemnation from international
  organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being
  re-welcomed into the international community.

Tokelau
  Originally settled by Polynesian emigrants from surrounding
  island groups, the Tokelau Islands were made a British protectorate
  in 1889. They were transferred to New Zealand administration in
  1925. Referenda held in 2006 and 2007 to change the status of the
  islands from that of a New Zealand territory to one of free
  association with New Zealand did not meet the needed threshold for
  approval.

Tonga
  Tonga - unique among Pacific nations - never completely lost
  its indigenous governance. The archipelagos of "The Friendly
  Islands" were united into a Polynesian kingdom in 1845. Tonga became
  a constitutional monarchy in 1875 and a British protectorate in
  1900; it withdrew from the protectorate and joined the Commonwealth
  of Nations in 1970. Tonga remains the only monarchy in the Pacific.

Trinidad and Tobago
  First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came
  under British control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar
  industry was hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834.
  Manpower was replaced with the importation of contract laborers from
  India between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well
  as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910
  added another important export. Independence was attained in 1962.
  The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks
  largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
  Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.
  The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.

Tunisia
  Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia
  culminated in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a
  protectorate. Agitation for independence in the decades following
  World War I was finally successful in getting the French to
  recognize Tunisia as an independent state in 1956. The country's
  first president, Habib BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party
  state. He dominated the country for 31 years, repressing Islamic
  fundamentalism and establishing rights for women unmatched by any
  other Arab nation. In November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from
  office and replaced by Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup.
  BEN ALI is currently serving his fifth consecutive five-year term as
  president. Tunisia has long taken a moderate, non-aligned stance in
  its foreign relations. Domestically, it has sought to defuse rising
  pressure for a more open political society.

Turkey
  Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants
  of the defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who
  was later honored with the title Ataturk or "Father of the Turks."
  Under his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging
  social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party
  rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950
  election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful
  transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have
  multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of
  instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980),
  which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political
  power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the
  ouster - popularly dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the then
  Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus
  in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since
  acted as patron state to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
  which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984
  by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's
  Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the
  Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives.
  After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents
  largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK
  announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK
  increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a
  member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the
  European Community. Over the past decade, it has undertaken many
  reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy; it began accession
  membership talks with the European Union in 2005.

Turkmenistan
  Eastern Turkmenistan for centuries formed part of the
  Persian province of Khurasan; in medieval times Merv (today known as
  Mary) was one of the great cities of the Islamic world and an
  important stop on the Silk Road. Annexed by Russia between 1865 and
  1885, Turkmenistan became a Soviet republic in 1924. It achieved
  independence upon the dissolution of the USSR in 1991. Extensive
  hydrocarbon/natural gas reserves could prove a boon to this
  underdeveloped country once extraction and delivery projects are
  expanded. The Turkmen Government is actively working to diversify
  its gas export routes beyond the still dominant Russian pipeline
  network. In 2010, new gas export pipelines that carry Turkmen gas to
  China and to northern Iran began operating, effectively ending the
  Russian monopoly on Turkmen gas exports. President for Life
  Saparmurat NYYAZOW died in December 2006, and Turkmenistan held its
  first multi-candidate presidential election in February 2007.
  Gurbanguly BERDIMUHAMEDOW, a deputy cabinet chairman under NYYAZOW,
  emerged as the country's new president.

Turks and Caicos Islands
  The islands were part of the UK's Jamaican
  colony until 1962, when they assumed the status of a separate crown
  colony upon Jamaica's independence. The governor of The Bahamas
  oversaw affairs from 1965 to 1973. With Bahamian independence, the
  islands received a separate governor in 1973. Although independence
  was agreed upon for 1982, the policy was reversed and the islands
  remain a British overseas territory.

Tuvalu
  In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the
  Gilbert and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice
  Islands to vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert
  Islands. The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate
  British colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000,
  Tuvalu negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv"
  for $50 million in royalties over a 12-year period.

Uganda
  The colonial boundaries created by Britain to delimit Uganda
  grouped together a wide range of ethnic groups with different
  political systems and cultures. These differences prevented the
  establishment of a working political community after independence
  was achieved in 1962. The dictatorial regime of Idi AMIN (1971-79)
  was responsible for the deaths of some 300,000 opponents; guerrilla
  war and human rights abuses under Milton OBOTE (1980-85) claimed at
  least another 100,000 lives. The rule of Yoweri MUSEVENI since 1986
  has brought relative stability and economic growth to Uganda. During
  the 1990s, the government promulgated non-party presidential and
  legislative elections.

Ukraine
  Ukraine was the center of the first eastern Slavic state,
  Kyivan Rus, which during the 10th and 11th centuries was the largest
  and most powerful state in Europe. Weakened by internecine quarrels
  and Mongol invasions, Kyivan Rus was incorporated into the Grand
  Duchy of Lithuania and eventually into the Polish-Lithuanian
  Commonwealth. The cultural and religious legacy of Kyivan Rus laid
  the foundation for Ukrainian nationalism through subsequent
  centuries. A new Ukrainian state, the Cossack Hetmanate, was
  established during the mid-17th century after an uprising against
  the Poles. Despite continuous Muscovite pressure, the Hetmanate
  managed to remain autonomous for well over 100 years. During the
  latter part of the 18th century, most Ukrainian ethnographic
  territory was absorbed by the Russian Empire. Following the collapse
  of czarist Russia in 1917, Ukraine was able to achieve a short-lived
  period of independence (1917-20), but was reconquered and forced to
  endure a brutal Soviet rule that engineered two forced famines
  (1921-22 and 1932-33) in which over 8 million died. In World War II,
  German and Soviet armies were responsible for some 7 to 8 million
  more deaths. Although final independence for Ukraine was achieved in
  1991 with the dissolution of the USSR, democracy and prosperity
  remained elusive as the legacy of state control and endemic
  corruption stalled efforts at economic reform, privatization, and
  civil liberties. A peaceful mass protest "Orange Revolution" in the
  closing months of 2004 forced the authorities to overturn a rigged
  presidential election and to allow a new internationally monitored
  vote that swept into power a reformist slate under Viktor
  YUSHCHENKO. Subsequent internal squabbles in the YUSHCHENKO camp
  allowed his rival Viktor YANUKOVYCH to stage a comeback in
  parliamentary elections and become prime minister in August of 2006.
  An early legislative election, brought on by a political crisis in
  the spring of 2007, saw Yuliya TYMOSHENKO, as head of an "Orange"
  coalition, installed as a new prime minister in December 2007.
  Viktor YANUKOVUYCH was elected president in a February 2010 run-off
  election that observers assessed as meeting most international
  standards. The following month, the Rada approved a vote of
  no-confidence prompting Yuliya TYMOSHENKO to resign from her post as
  prime minister.

United Arab Emirates
  The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast
  granted the UK control of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th
  century treaties. In 1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman,
  Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to
  form the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by
  Ra's al Khaymah. The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of
  leading West European nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and
  its moderate foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a
  vital role in the affairs of the region. For more than three
  decades, oil and global finance drove the UAE's economy, however, in
  2008-09, the confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real
  estate prices, and the international banking crisis hit the UAE
  especially hard.

United Kingdom
  The United Kingdom has historically played a leading
  role in developing parliamentary democracy and in advancing
  literature and science. At its zenith in the 19th century, the
  British Empire stretched over one-fourth of the earth's surface. The
  first half of the 20th century saw the UK's strength seriously
  depleted in two World Wars and the Irish republic withdraw from the
  union. The second half witnessed the dismantling of the Empire and
  the UK rebuilding itself into a modern and prosperous European
  nation. As one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council,
  a founding member of NATO, and of the Commonwealth, the UK pursues a
  global approach to foreign policy. The UK is also an active member
  of the EU, although it chose to remain outside the Economic and
  Monetary Union. The Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for
  Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly were established in 1999.
  The latter was suspended until May 2007 due to wrangling over the
  peace process, but devolution was fully completed in March 2010.

United States
  Britain's American colonies broke with the mother
  country in 1776 and were recognized as the new nation of the United
  States of America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the
  19th and 20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13
  as the nation expanded across the North American continent and
  acquired a number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic
  experiences in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in
  which a northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy
  of 11 southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s,
  an economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force
  lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the
  end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most
  powerful nation state. Over a span of more than five decades, the
  economy has achieved steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,
  and rapid advances in technology.

United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges
  All of the following
  US Pacific island territories except Midway Atoll constitute the
  Pacific Remote Islands National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Complex and as
  such are managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the US
  Department of the Interior. Midway Atoll NWR has been included in a
  Refuge Complex with the Hawaiian Islands NWR and also designated as
  part of Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. These remote
  refuges are the most widespread collection of marine- and
  terrestrial-life protected areas on the planet under a single
  country's jurisdiction. They sustain many endemic species including
  corals, fish, shellfish, marine mammals, seabirds, water birds, land
  birds, insects, and vegetation not found elsewhere.
  Baker Island: The US took possession of the island in 1857. Its
  guano deposits were mined by US and British companies during the
  second half of the 19th century. In 1935, a short-lived attempt at
  colonization began on this island but was disrupted by World War II
  and thereafter abandoned. The island was established as a NWR in
  1974.
  Howland Island: Discovered by the US early in the 19th century, the
  uninhabited atoll was officially claimed by the US in 1857. Both US
  and British companies mined for guano deposits until about 1890. In
  1935, a short-lived attempt at colonization began on this island,
  similar to the effort on nearby Baker Island, but was disrupted by
  World War II and thereafter abandoned. The famed American aviatrix
  Amelia EARHART disappeared while seeking out Howland Island as a
  refueling stop during her 1937 round-the-world flight; Earhart
  Light, a day beacon near the middle of the west coast, was named in
  her memory. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.
  Jarvis Island: First discovered by the British in 1821, the
  uninhabited island was annexed by the US in 1858 but abandoned in
  1879 after tons of guano had been removed. The UK annexed the island
  in 1889 but never carried out plans for further exploitation. The US
  occupied and reclaimed the island in 1935. It was abandoned in 1942
  during World War II. The island was established as a NWR in 1974.
  Johnston Atoll: Both the US and the Kingdom of Hawaii annexed
  Johnston Atoll in 1858, but it was the US that mined the guano
  deposits until the late 1880s. Johnston and Sand Islands were
  designated wildlife refuges in 1926. The US Navy took over the atoll
  in 1934. Subsequently, the US Air Force assumed control in 1948. The
  site was used for high-altitude nuclear tests in the 1950s and
  1960s. Until late in 2000 the atoll was maintained as a storage and
  disposal site for chemical weapons. Munitions destruction, cleanup,
  and closure of the facility were completed by May 2005. The Fish and
  Wildlife Service and the US Air Force are currently discussing
  future management options; in the interim, Johnston Atoll and the
  three-mile Naval Defensive Sea around it remain under the
  jurisdiction and administrative control of the US Air Force.
  Kingman Reef: The US annexed the reef in 1922. Its sheltered lagoon
  served as a way station for flying boats on Hawaii-to-American Samoa
  flights during the late 1930s. There are no terrestrial plants on
  the reef, which is frequently awash, but it does support abundant
  and diverse marine fauna and flora. In 2001, the waters surrounding
  the reef out to 12 nm were designated a US NWR.
  Midway Islands: The US took formal possession of the islands in
  1867. The laying of the trans-Pacific cable, which passed through
  the islands, brought the first residents in 1903. Between 1935 and
  1947, Midway was used as a refueling stop for trans-Pacific flights.
  The US naval victory over a Japanese fleet off Midway in 1942 was
  one of the turning points of World War II. The islands continued to
  serve as a naval station until closed in 1993. Today the islands are
  a NWR and are the site of the world's largest Laysan albatross
  colony.
  Palmyra Atoll: The Kingdom of Hawaii claimed the atoll in 1862, and
  the US included it among the Hawaiian Islands when it annexed the
  archipelago in 1898. The Hawaii Statehood Act of 1959 did not
  include Palmyra Atoll, which is now partly privately owned by the
  Nature Conservancy with the rest owned by the Federal government and
  managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. These organizations are
  managing the atoll as a wildlife refuge. The lagoons and surrounding
  waters within the 12 nm US territorial seas were transferred to the
  US Fish and Wildlife Service and designated as a NWR in January 2001.

Uruguay
  Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military
  stronghold, soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an
  important commercial center. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by
  Brazil in 1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later
  and secured its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The
  administrations of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century
  established widespread political, social, and economic reforms that
  established a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla
  movement named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led
  Uruguay's president to cede control of the government to the
  military in 1973. By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the
  military continued to expand its hold over the government. Civilian
  rule was not restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente
  Amplio Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170
  years of political control previously held by the Colorado and
  Blanco parties. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among
  the freest on the continent.

Uzbekistan
  Russia conquered the territory of present-day Uzbekistan
  in the late 19th century. Stiff resistance to the Red Army after the
  Boshevik Revolution was eventually suppressed and a socialist
  republic established in 1924. During the Soviet era, intensive
  production of "white gold" (cotton) and grain led to overuse of
  agrochemicals and the depletion of water supplies, which have left
  the land poisoned and the Aral Sea and certain rivers half dry.
  Independent since 1991, the country seeks to gradually lessen its
  dependence on agriculture while developing its mineral and petroleum
  reserves. Current concerns include terrorism by Islamic militants,
  economic stagnation, and the curtailment of human rights and
  democratization.

Vanuatu
  Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct
  language, migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding
  European exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern
  accounts for the complex linguistic diversity found on the
  archipelago to this day. The British and French, who settled the New
  Hebrides in the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French
  Condominium, which administered the islands until independence in
  1980, when the new name of Vanuatu was adopted.

Venezuela
  Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the
  collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New
  Granada, which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the
  20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military
  strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social
  reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since
  1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president since 1999, seeks to implement his
  "21st Century Socialism," which purports to alleviate social ills
  while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and
  existing democratic institutions. Current concerns include: a
  weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a
  politicized military, drug-related violence along the Colombian
  border, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price
  fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are
  endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.

Vietnam
  The conquest of Vietnam by France began in 1858 and was
  completed by 1884. It became part of French Indochina in 1887.
  Vietnam declared independence after World War II, but France
  continued to rule until its 1954 defeat by Communist forces under Ho
  Chi MINH. Under the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was divided into
  the Communist North and anti-Communist South. US economic and
  military aid to South Vietnam grew through the 1960s in an attempt
  to bolster the government, but US armed forces were withdrawn
  following a cease-fire agreement in 1973. Two years later, North
  Vietnamese forces overran the South reuniting the country under
  Communist rule. Despite the return of peace, for over a decade the
  country experienced little economic growth because of conservative
  leadership policies, the persecution and mass exodus of individuals
  - many of them successful South Vietnamese merchants - and growing
  international isolation. However, since the enactment of Vietnam's
  "doi moi" (renovation) policy in 1986, Vietnamese authorities have
  committed to increased economic liberalization and enacted
  structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce
  more competitive, export-driven industries. The Communist leaders,
  however, maintain control on political expression and have resisted
  outside calls to improve human rights. The country continues to
  experience small-scale protests from various groups, the vast
  majority connected to land-use issues, calls for increased political
  space and the lack of equitable mechanisms for resolving disputes.
  Various ethnic minorities, such as the Montagnards of the Central
  Highlands and the Khmer Krom in the southern delta region, have also
  held protests.

Virgin Islands
  During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided
  into two territorial units, one English and the other Danish.
  Sugarcane, produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy
  during the 18th and early 19th centuries. In 1917, the US purchased
  the Danish portion, which had been in economic decline since the
  abolition of slavery in 1848.

Wake Island
  The US annexed Wake Island in 1899 for a cable station.
  An important air and naval base was constructed in 1940-41. In
  December 1941, the island was captured by the Japanese and held
  until the end of World War II. In subsequent years, Wake was
  developed as a stopover and refueling site for military and
  commercial aircraft transiting the Pacific. Since 1974, the island's
  airstrip has been used by the US military, as well as for emergency
  landings. Although operations on the island were suspended and all
  personnel evacuated in August 2006 with the approach of super
  typhoon IOKE (category 5), damage was comparatively minor. A US Air
  Force repair team restored full capability to the airfield and
  facilities, which remains a vital strategic link in the Pacific
  region.

Wallis and Futuna
  The Futuna island group was discovered by the
  Dutch in 1616 and Wallis by the British in 1767, but it was the
  French who declared a protectorate over the islands in 1842. In
  1959, the inhabitants of the islands voted to become a French
  overseas territory.

West Bank
  The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on
  Interim Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional
  period of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
  Under a series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September
  1999, Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security
  and civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of
  the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the
  permanent status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following
  the outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the
  Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final
  settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the
  two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic
  Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late
  2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month
  later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments
  in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,
  Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and
  dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew
  settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank
  settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,
  and most access to the Gaza Strip. In January 2006, the Islamic
  Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian
  Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government
  in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating
  with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the
  international community so as to lift economic sanctions on
  Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in
  the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous
  Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS
  Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi
  Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National
  Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.
  However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,
  HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and
  governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG
  and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government
  in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the
  NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered
  reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge
  their differences. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of
  the Gaza Strip and ABBAS and the Fatah-dominated PA governing the
  West Bank. FAYYAD and his PA government continue to implement a
  series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the
  West Bank. ABBAS has said he will not resume negotiations with
  current Prime Minister NETANYAHU until Israel halts all settlement
  activity in the West Bank and Jerusalem.

Western Sahara
  Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western
  Sahara (formerly Spanish Sahara) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the
  territory in 1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla
  war with the Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended
  in a 1991 UN-brokered cease-fire; a UN-organized referendum on the
  territory's final status has been repeatedly postponed. The UN since
  2007 has sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the
  Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the
  status of Western Sahara. Morocco has put forward an autonomy
  proposal for the territory, which would allow for some local
  administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty. The
  Polisario, with Algeria's support, demands a popular referendum that
  includes the option of independence.

World
  Globally, the 20th century was marked by: (a) two devastating
  world wars; (b) the Great Depression of the 1930s; (c) the end of
  vast colonial empires; (d) rapid advances in science and technology,
  from the first airplane flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina (US) to
  the landing on the moon; (e) the Cold War between the Western
  alliance and the Warsaw Pact nations; (f) a sharp rise in living
  standards in North America, Europe, and Japan; (g) increased
  concerns about the environment, including loss of forests, shortages
  of energy and water, the decline in biological diversity, and air
  pollution; (h) the onset of the AIDS epidemic; and (i) the ultimate
  emergence of the US as the only world superpower. The planet's
  population continues to explode: from 1 billion in 1820, to 2
  billion in 1930, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in
  1988, and 6 billion in 2000. For the 21st century, the continued
  exponential growth in science and technology raises both hopes
  (e.g., advances in medicine) and fears (e.g., development of even
  more lethal weapons of war).

Yemen
  North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918.
  The British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern
  port of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became
  South Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a
  Marxist orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of
  Yemenis from the south to the north contributed to two decades of
  hostility between the states. The two countries were formally
  unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist
  movement in 1994 was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and
  Yemen agreed to a delimitation of their border.

Zambia
  The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the
  [British] South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by
  the UK in 1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining
  spurred development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia
  upon independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper
  prices and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991
  brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996
  saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001
  was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a
  legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate
  Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anticorruption
  investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the
  previous administration. In 2006-07, this task force successfully
  prosecuted four cases, including a landmark civil case in the UK in
  which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable
  for USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election
  that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008,
  he was succeeded by his Vice President Rupiah BANDA, who
  subsequently won a special presidential election in October 2008.

Zimbabwe
  The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South
  Africa Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that
  favored whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally
  declared its independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and
  demanded more complete voting rights for the black African majority
  in the country (then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla
  uprising finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as
  Zimbabwe) in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister,
  has been the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has
  dominated the country's political system since independence. His
  chaotic land redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an
  exodus of white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in
  widespread shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international
  condemnation, MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure
  his reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation
  to win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary
  election, allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate
  the Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April
  2005, Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an
  urban rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of
  the homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the
  opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls
  on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store
  shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008
  contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the
  ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of
  seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the
  most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win
  outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008,
  considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led
  to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence
  of vote tampering and ballot-box stuffing resulted in international
  condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a
  power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and
  TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February
  2009, although the leaders have yet failed to agree upon many key
  outstanding governmental issues.
