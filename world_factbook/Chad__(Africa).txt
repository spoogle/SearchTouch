Chad  (Africa)

Introduction ::Chad




Background:


Chad, part of France's African holdings until 1960, endured three
decades of civil warfare as well as invasions by Libya before a
semblance of peace was finally restored in 1990. The government
eventually drafted a democratic constitution and held flawed
presidential elections in 1996 and 2001. In 1998, a rebellion broke
out in northern Chad, which has sporadically flared up despite
several peace agreements between the government and the rebels. In
2005, new rebel groups emerged in western Sudan and made probing
attacks into eastern Chad despite signing peace agreements in
December 2006 and October 2007. Power remains in the hands of an
ethnic minority. In June 2005, President Idriss DEBY held a
referendum successfully removing constitutional term limits and won
another controversial election in 2006. Sporadic rebel campaigns
continued throughout 2006 and 2007. The capital experienced a
significant rebel threat in early 2008.

Economy ::Chad




Economy - overview:


Chad's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be boosted by
major foreign direct investment projects in the oil sector that
began in 2000. At least 80% of Chad's population relies on
subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. Chad's
economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position, high
energy costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on foreign
assistance and foreign capital for most public and private sector
investment projects. A consortium led by two US companies has been
investing $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1
billion barrels - in southern Chad. Chinese companies are also
expanding exploration efforts and are currently building a 300-km
pipleline and the country's first refinery. The nation's total oil
reserves are estimated at 1.5 billion barrels. Oil production came
on stream in late 2003. Chad began to export oil in 2004. Cotton,
cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export
earnings.

Transnational Issues ::Chad




Disputes - international:


since 2003, Janjawid armed militia and the Sudanese military have
driven hundreds of thousands of Darfur residents into Chad; Chad
remains an important mediator in the Sudanese civil conflict,
reducing tensions with Sudan arising from cross-border banditry;
Chadian Aozou rebels reside in southern Libya; only Nigeria and
Cameroon have heeded the Lake Chad Commission's admonition to ratify
the delimitation treaty, which also includes the Chad-Niger and
Niger-Nigeria boundaries



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 234,000 (Sudan); 54,200 (Central
African Republic)

IDPs: 178,918 (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Chad is a source, transit, and destination
country for children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and
commercial sexual exploitation; the majority of children are
trafficked within Chad for involuntary domestic servitude, forced
cattle herding, forced begging, forced labor in petty commerce or
the fishing industry, or for commercial sexual exploitation; to a
lesser extent, Chadian children are also trafficked to Cameroon, the
Central African Republic, and Nigeria for cattle herding; children
may also be trafficked from Cameroon and the Central African
Republic to Chad's oil producing regions for sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Chad does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking and is not making any significant efforts to do so;
although facing resource constraints, the government has the
capacity to conduct basic anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts,
yet did not do so during the last year; it showed no results in
enforcing government policy prohibiting the recruitment of child
soldiers; Chad has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2009)
