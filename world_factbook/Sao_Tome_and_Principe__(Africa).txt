Sao Tome and Principe  (Africa)

Introduction ::Sao Tome and Principe




Background:


Discovered and claimed by Portugal in the late 15th century, the
islands' sugar-based economy gave way to coffee and cocoa in the
19th century - all grown with plantation slave labor, a form of
which lingered into the 20th century. While independence was
achieved in 1975, democratic reforms were not instituted until the
late 1980s. The country held its first free elections in 1991, but
frequent internal wrangling between the various political parties
precipitated repeated changes in leadership and two failed coup
attempts in 1995 and 2003. The recent discovery of oil in the Gulf
of Guinea promises to attract increased attention to the small
island nation.

Economy ::Sao Tome and Principe




Economy - overview:


This small, poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on
cocoa since independence in 1975. Cocoa production has substantially
declined in recent years because of drought and mismanagement. Sao
Tome and Principe has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods,
consumer goods, and a substantial amount of food. Over the years, it
has had difficulty servicing its external debt and has relied
heavily on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Sao Tome and
Principe benefited from $200 million in debt relief in December 2000
under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program, which
helped bring down the country's $300 million debt burden. In August
2005, the government signed on to a new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility (PRGF) program worth $4.3 million. Considerable
potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the
government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The
government also has attempted to reduce price controls and
subsidies. Potential exists for the development of petroleum
resources in Sao Tome and Principe's territorial waters in the
oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being jointly developed in a
60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual production is at least
several years off. The first production licenses were sold in 2004,
though a dispute over licensing with Nigeria delayed the country's
receipt of more than $20 million in signing bonuses for almost a
year.

Military - note:


Sao Tome and Principe's army is a tiny force with almost no
resources at its disposal and would be wholly ineffective operating
unilaterally; infantry equipment is considered simple to operate and
maintain but may require refurbishment or replacement after 25 years
in tropical climates; poor pay, working conditions, and alleged
nepotism in the promotion of officers have been problems in the
past, as reflected in the 1995 and 2003 coups; these issues are
being addressed with foreign assistance aimed at improving the army
and its focus on realistic security concerns; command is exercised
from the president, through the Minister of Defense, to the Chief of
the Armed Forces staff (2005)
