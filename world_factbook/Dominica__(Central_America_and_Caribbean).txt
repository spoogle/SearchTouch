Dominica  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Dominica




Background:


Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonized by
Europeans due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs.
France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the
island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence,
Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical
administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia CHARLES, the
first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office
for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are
the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

Economy ::Dominica




Economy - overview:


The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture - primarily
bananas - in years past, but increasingly has been driven by tourism
as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an "ecotourism"
destination. In order to diversify the island's production base, the
government also is attempting to develop an offshore financial
sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to develop geothermal
energy resources. In 2003, the government began a comprehensive
restructuring of the economy - including elimination of price
controls, privatization of the state banana company, and tax
increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to meet
IMF requirements. This restructuring paved the way for an economic
recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high - and
helped to reduce the debt burden, which remains at about 85% of GDP.
Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages
equivalent to 20% of GDP. In 2009, growth slowed as a result of the
global recession; it picked up only slightly in 2010.
