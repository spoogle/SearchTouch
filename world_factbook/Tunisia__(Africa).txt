Tunisia  (Africa)

Introduction ::Tunisia




Background:


Rivalry between French and Italian interests in Tunisia culminated
in a French invasion in 1881 and the creation of a protectorate.
Agitation for independence in the decades following World War I was
finally successful in getting the French to recognize Tunisia as an
independent state in 1956. The country's first president, Habib
BOURGUIBA, established a strict one-party state. He dominated the
country for 31 years, repressing Islamic fundamentalism and
establishing rights for women unmatched by any other Arab nation. In
November 1987, BOURGUIBA was removed from office and replaced by
Zine el Abidine BEN ALI in a bloodless coup. BEN ALI is currently
serving his fifth consecutive five-year term as president. Tunisia
has long taken a moderate, non-aligned stance in its foreign
relations. Domestically, it has sought to defuse rising pressure for
a more open political society.

Economy ::Tunisia




Economy - overview:


Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining,
tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Governmental control of economic
affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the past
decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax
structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social
policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia
relative to the region. Real growth, which averaged almost 5% over
the past decade, declined to 4.6% in 2008 and to 3-4% in 2009-10
because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in
Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However, development of
non-textile manufacturing, a recovery in agricultural production,
and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the
economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even
higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities
for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing
population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include:
privatizing industry, liberalizing the investment code to increase
foreign investment, improving government efficiency, reducing the
trade deficit, and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the
impoverished south and west.

network, the government has awarded a concession to build and
operate a VSAT network with international connectivity; rural areas
are served by wireless local loops; competition between the two
mobile-cellular service providers has resulted in lower activation
and usage charges and a strong surge in subscribership; a third
mobile, fixed, and ISP operator was licensed in 2009 and will begin
offering services in 2010; expansion of mobile-cellular services to
include multimedia messaging and e-mail and Internet to mobile phone
services also leading to a surge in subscribership; overall
fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity is about 100 telephones
per 100 persons
