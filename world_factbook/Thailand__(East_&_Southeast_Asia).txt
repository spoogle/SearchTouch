Thailand  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Thailand




Background:


A unified Thai kingdom was established in the mid-14th century.
Known as Siam until 1939, Thailand is the only Southeast Asian
country never to have been taken over by a European power. A
bloodless revolution in 1932 led to a constitutional monarchy. In
alliance with Japan during World War II, Thailand became a US treaty
ally following the conflict. A military coup in September 2006
ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat. The interim government
held elections in December 2007 that saw the former pro-THAKSIN
People's Power Party (PPP) emerge at the head of a coalition
government. The anti-THAKSIN People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD)
in May 2008 began street demonstrations against the new government,
eventually occupying the prime minister's office in August and
Bangkok's two international airports in November. The PAD ended
their protests in early December 2008 following a court ruling that
dissolved the ruling PPP and two other coalition parties for
election violations. The Democrat Party then formed a new coalition
government and ABHISIT Wetchachiwa became prime minister. In October
2008 THAKSIN went into voluntary exile to avoid imprisonment for a
corruption conviction, and has since agitated his followers from
abroad. THAKSIN supporters re-organized into the United Front for
Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) and rioted in April 2009,
shutting down an ASEAN meeting in Phuket, and in early 2010
protested a court verdict confiscating most of THAKSIN's wealth.
Between March and May 2010, the UDD staged large protests and
occupied several blocks of downtown Bangkok. A government operation
to disperse the protesters after nine weeks led to clashes that
resulted in 89 deaths and an estimated $1.5 billion in arson-related
property losses. These protests exposed major cleavages in the Thai
body politic which continue to hamper the current government. Since
January 2004, thousands have been killed as separatists in
Thailand's southern ethnic Malay-Muslim provinces increased the
violence associated with their cause.

Economy ::Thailand




Economy - overview:


With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise economy,
generally pro-investment policies, and strong export industries,
Thailand enjoyed solid growth from 2000 to 2008 - averaging more
than 4% per year - as it recovered from the Asian financial crisis
of 1997-98. Thai exports - mostly machinery and electronic
components, agricultural commodities, and jewelry - continue to
drive the economy, accounting for more than half of GDP. The global
financial crisis of 2008-09 severely cut Thailand's exports, with
most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In 2009, the economy
contracted 2.2%. In 2010, Thailand's economy expanded 7.6%, its
fastest pace since 1995, as exports rebounded from their depressed
2009 level. Antigovernment protests during March-May and the
country's polarized political situation had - at most - a temporary
impact on business and consumer confidence. Although tourism was hit
hard during the protests, its quick recovery helped boost consumer
confidence to new highs. Moreover, business and investor sentiment
remained buoyant as Thailand's stock market grew almost 5% during
the three-month period. The economy probably will continue to
experience high grow well into 2011.
