Field Listing :: Legal system

  This entry provides the description of a country's legal system; it
  also includes information on acceptance of International Court of
  Justice (ICJ) jurisdiction. The legal systems of nearly all
  countries are generally modeled upon elements of five main types:
  civil law (including French law, the Napoleonic Code, Roman law,
  Roman-Dutch law, and Spanish law); common law (including United
  State law); customary law; mixed or pluralistic law; and religious
  law (including Islamic law). An additional type of legal system -
  international law, which governs the conduct of independent nations
  in their relationships with one another - is also addressed below.
  The following list describes these legal systems, the countries or
  world regions where these systems are enforced, and a brief
  statement on the origins and major features of each.
  Civil Law - The most widespread type of legal system in the world,
  applied in various forms in approximately 150 countries. Also
  referred to as European continental law, the civil law system is
  derived mainly from the Roman Corpus Juris Civilus, (Body of Civil
  Law), a collection of laws and legal interpretations compiled under
  the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Justinian I between A.D. 528 and
  565. The major feature of civil law systems is that the laws are
  organized into systematic written codes. In civil law the sources
  recognized as authoritative are principally legislation - especially
  codifications in constitutions or statutes enacted by governments -
  and secondarily, custom. The civil law systems in some countries are
  based on more than one code.
  Common Law - A type of legal system, often synonymous with "English
  common law," which is the system of England and Wales in the UK, and
  is also in force in approximately 80 countries formerly part of or
  influenced by the former British Empire. English common law reflects
  Biblical influences as well as remnants of law systems imposed by
  early conquerors including the Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans.
  Some legal scholars attribute the formation of the English common
  law system to King Henry II (r.1154-1189). Until the time of his
  reign, laws customary among England's various manorial and
  ecclesiastical (church) jurisdictions were administered locally.
  Henry II established the king's court and designated that laws were
  "common" to the entire English realm. The foundation of English
  common law is "legal precedent" - referred to as stare decisis,
  meaning "to stand by things decided." In the English common law
  system, court judges are bound in their decisions in large part by
  the rules and other doctrines developed - and supplemented over time
  - by the judges of earlier English courts.
  Customary Law - A type of legal system that serves as the basis of,
  or has influenced, the present-day laws in approximately 40
  countries - mostly in Africa, but some in the Pacific islands,
  Europe, and the Near East. Customary law is also referred to as
  "primitive law," "unwritten law," "indigenous law," and "folk law."
  There is no single history of customary law such as that found in
  Roman civil law, English common law, Islamic law, or the Napoleonic
  Civil Code. The earliest systems of law in human society were
  customary, and usually developed in small agrarian and
  hunter-gatherer communities. As the term implies, customary law is
  based upon the customs of a community. Common attributes of
  customary legal systems are that they are seldom written down, they
  embody an organized set of rules regulating social relations, and
  they are agreed upon by members of the community. Although such law
  systems include sanctions for law infractions, resolution tends to
  be reconciliatory rather than punitive. A number of African states
  practiced customary law many centuries prior to colonial influences.
  Following colonization, such laws were written down and incorporated
  to varying extents into the legal systems imposed by their colonial
  powers.
  European Union Law - A sub-discipline of international law known as
  "supranational law" in which the rights of sovereign nations are
  limited in relation to one another. Also referred to as the Law of
  the European Union or Community Law, it is the unique and complex
  legal system that operates in tandem with the laws of the 27 member
  states of the European Union (EU). Similar to federal states, the EU
  legal system ensures compliance from the member states because of
  the Union's decentralized political nature. The European Court of
  Justice (ECJ), established in 1952 by the Treaty of Paris, has been
  largely responsible for the development of EU law. Fundamental
  principles of European Union law include: subsidiarity - the notion
  that issues be handled by the smallest, lowest, or least centralized
  competent authority; proportionality - the EU may only act to the
  extent needed to achieve its objectives; conferral - the EU is a
  union of member states, and all its authorities are voluntarily
  granted by its members; legal certainty - requires that legal rules
  be clear and precise; and precautionary principle - a moral and
  political principle stating that if an action or policy might cause
  severe or irreversible harm to the public or to the environment, in
  the absence of a scientific consensus that harm would not ensue, the
  burden of proof falls on those who would advocate taking the action.
  French Law - A type of civil law that is the legal system of France.
  The French system also serves as the basis for, or is mixed with,
  other legal systems in approximately 50 countries, notably in North
  Africa, the Near East, and the French territories and dependencies.
  French law is primarily codified or systematic written civil law.
  Prior to the French Revolution (1789-1799), France had no single
  national legal system. Laws in the northern areas of present-day
  France were mostly local customs based on privileges and exemptions
  granted by kings and feudal lords, while in the southern areas Roman
  law predominated. The introduction of the Napoleonic Civil Code
  during the reign of Napoleon I in the first decade of the 19th
  century brought major reforms to the French legal system, many of
  which remain part of France's current legal structure, though all
  have been extensively amended or redrafted to address a modern
  nation. French law distinguishes between "public law" and "private
  law." Public law relates to government, the French Constitution,
  public administration, and criminal law. Private law covers issues
  between private citizens or corporations. The most recent changes to
  the French legal system - introduced in the 1980s - were the
  decentralization laws, which transferred authority from centrally
  appointed government representatives to locally elected
  representatives of the people.
  International Law - The law of the international community, or the
  body of customary rules and treaty rules accepted as legally binding
  by states in their relations with each other. International law
  differs from other legal systems in that it primarily concerns
  sovereign political entities. There are three separate disciplines
  of international law: public international law, which governs the
  relationship between provinces and international entities and
  includes treaty law, law of the sea, international criminal law, and
  international humanitarian law; private international law, which
  addresses legal jurisdiction; and supranational law - a legal
  framework wherein countries are bound by regional agreements in
  which the laws of the member countries are held inapplicable when in
  conflict with supranational laws. At present the European Union is
  the only entity under a supranational legal system. The term
  "international law" was coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780 in his
  Principles of Morals and Legislation, though laws governing
  relations between states have been recognized from very early times
  (many centuries B.C.). Modern international law developed alongside
  the emergence and growth of the European nation-states beginning in
  the early 16th century. Other factors that influenced the
  development of international law included the revival of legal
  studies, the growth of international trade, and the practice of
  exchanging emissaries and establishing legations. The sources of
  International law are set out in Article 38-1 of the Statute of the
  International Court of Justice within the UN Charter.
  Islamic Law - The most widespread type of religious law, it is the
  legal system enforced in over 30 countries, particularly in the Near
  East, but also in Central and South Asia, Africa, and Indonesia. In
  many countries Islamic law operates in tandem with a civil law
  system. Islamic law is embodied in the sharia, an Arabic word
  meaning "the right path." Sharia covers all aspects of public and
  private life and organizes them into five categories: obligatory,
  recommended, permitted, disliked, and forbidden. The primary sources
  of sharia law are the Qur'an, believed by Muslims to be the word of
  God revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the angel Gabriel, and the
  Sunnah, the teachings of the Prophet and his works. In addition to
  these two primary sources, traditional Sunni Muslims recognize the
  consensus of Muhammad's companions and Islamic jurists on certain
  issues, called ijmas, and various forms of reasoning, including
  analogy by legal scholars, referred to as qiyas. Shia Muslims reject
  ijmas and qiyas as sources of sharia law.
  Mixed Law - Also referred to as pluralistic law, mixed law consists
  of elements of some or all of the other main types of legal systems
  - civil, common, customary, and religious. The mixed legal systems
  of a number of countries came about when colonial powers overlaid
  their own legal systems upon colonized regions but retained elements
  of the colonies' existing legal systems.
  Napoleonic Civil Code - A type of civil law, referred to as the
  Civil Code or Code Civil des Francais, forms part of the legal
  system of France, and underpins the legal systems of Bolivia, Egypt,
  Lebanon, Poland, and the US state of Louisiana. The Civil Code was
  established under Napoleon I, enacted in 1804, and officially
  designated the Code Napoleon in 1807. This legal system combined the
  Teutonic civil law tradition of the northern provinces of France
  with the Roman law tradition of the southern and eastern regions of
  the country. The Civil Code bears similarities in its arrangement to
  the Roman Body of Civil Law (see Civil Law above). As enacted in
  1804, the Code addressed personal status, property, and the
  acquisition of property. Codes added over the following six years
  included civil procedures, commercial law, criminal law and
  procedures, and a penal code.
  Religious Law - A legal system which stems from the sacred texts of
  religious traditions and in most cases professes to cover all
  aspects of life as a seamless part of devotional obligations to a
  transcendent, imminent, or deep philosophical reality. Implied as
  the basis of religious law is the concept of unalterability, because
  the word of God cannot be amended or legislated against by judges or
  governments. However, a detailed legal system generally requires
  human elaboration. The main types of religious law are sharia in
  Islam, halakha in Judaism, and canon law in some Christian groups.
  Sharia is the most widespread religious legal system (see Islamic
  Law), and is the sole system of law for countries including Iran,
  the Maldives, and Saudi Arabia. No country is fully governed by
  halakha, but Jewish people may decide to settle disputes through
  Jewish courts and be bound by their rulings. Canon law is not a
  divine law as such because it is not found in revelation. It is
  viewed instead as human law inspired by the word of God and applying
  the demands of that revelation to the actual situation of the
  church. Canon law regulates the internal ordering of the Roman
  Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Anglican
  Communion.
  Roman Law - A type of civil law developed in ancient Rome and
  practiced from the time of the city's founding (traditionally 753
  B.C.) until the fall of the Western Empire in the 5th century A.D.
  Roman law remained the legal system of the Byzantine (Eastern
  Empire) until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Preserved
  fragments of the first legal text, known as the Law of the Twelve
  Tables, dating from the 5th century B.C., contained specific
  provisions designed to change the prevailing customary law. Early
  Roman law was drawn from custom and statutes; later, during the time
  of the empire, emperors asserted their authority as the ultimate
  source of law. The basis for Roman laws was the idea that the exact
  form - not the intention - of words or of actions produced legal
  consequences. It was only in the late 6th century A.D. that a
  comprehensive Roman code of laws was published (see Civil Law
  above). Roman law served as the basis of law systems developed in a
  number of continental European countries.
  Roman-Dutch Law - A type of civil law based on Roman law as applied
  in the Netherlands. Roman-Dutch law serves as the basis for legal
  systems in seven African countries, as well as Guyana, Indonesia,
  and Sri Lanka. This law system, which originated in the province of
  Holland and expanded throughout the Netherlands (to be replaced by
  the French Civil Code in 1809), was instituted in a number of
  sub-Saharan African countries during the Dutch colonial period. The
  Dutch jurist/philosopher Hugo Grotius was the first to attempt to
  reduce Roman-Dutch civil law into a system in his Jurisprudence of
  Holland (written 1619-20, commentary published 1621). The Dutch
  historian/lawyer Simon van Leeuwen coined the term "Roman-Dutch law"
  in 1652.
  Spanish Law - A type of civil law, often referred to as the Spanish
  Civil Code, it is the present legal system of Spain and is the basis
  of legal systems in 12 countries mostly in Central and South
  America, but also in southwestern Europe, northern and western
  Africa, and southeastern Asia. The Spanish Civil Code reflects a
  complex mixture of customary, Roman, Napoleonic, local, and modern
  codified law. The laws of the Visigoth invaders of Spain in the 5th
  to 7th centuries had the earliest major influence on Spanish legal
  system development. The Christian Reconquest of Spain in the 11th
  through 15th centuries witnessed the development of customary law,
  which combined canon (religious) and Roman law. During several
  centuries of Hapsburg and Bourbon rule, systematic recompilations of
  the existing national legal system were attempted, but these often
  conflicted with local and regional customary civil laws. Legal
  system development for most of the 19th century concentrated on
  formulating a national civil law system, which was finally enacted
  in 1889 as the Spanish Civil Code. Several sections of the code have
  been revised, the most recent of which are the penal code in 1989
  and the judiciary code in 2001. The Spanish Civil Code separates
  public and private law. Public law includes constitutional law,
  administrative law, criminal law, process law, financial and tax
  law, and international public law. Private law includes civil law,
  commercial law, labor law, and international private law.
  United States Law - A type of common law, which is the basis of the
  legal system of the United States and that of its island possessions
  in the Caribbean and the Pacific. This legal system has several
  layers, more possibly than in most other countries, and is due in
  part to the division between federal and state law. The United
  States was founded not as one nation but as a union of 13 colonies,
  each claiming independence from the British Crown. The US
  Constitution, implemented in 1789, began shifting power away from
  the states and toward the federal government, though the states
  today retain substantial legal authority. US law draws its authority
  from four sources: constitutional law, statutory law, administrative
  regulations, and case law. Constitutional law is based on the US
  Constitution and serves as the supreme federal law. Taken together
  with those of the state constitutions, these documents outline the
  general structure of the federal and state governments and provide
  the rules and limits of power. US statutory law is legislation
  enacted by the US Congress and is codified in the United States
  Code. The 50 state legislatures have similar authority to enact
  state statutes. Administrative law is the authority delegated to
  federal and state executive agencies. Case law, also referred to as
  common law, covers areas where constitutional or statutory law is
  lacking. Case law is a collection of judicial decisions, customs,
  and general principles that began in England centuries ago, that
  were adopted in America at the time of the Revolution, and that
  continue to develop today.
