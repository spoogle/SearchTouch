Burkina Faso  (Africa)

Introduction ::Burkina Faso




Background:


Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) achieved independence from
France in 1960. Repeated military coups during the 1970s and 1980s
were followed by multiparty elections in the early 1990s. Current
President Blaise COMPAORE came to power in a 1987 military coup and
has won every election since then. Burkina Faso's high population
density and limited natural resources result in poor economic
prospects for the majority of its citizens. Recent unrest in Cote
d'Ivoire and northern Ghana has hindered the ability of several
hundred thousand seasonal Burkinabe farm workers to find employment
in neighboring countries.

Economy ::Burkina Faso




Economy - overview:


Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that relies heavily on
cotton and gold exports for revenue. The country has few natural
resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of the population is
engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is vulnerable to periodic
drought. Cotton is the main cash crop. Since 1998, Burkina Faso has
embarked upon a gradual privatization of state-owned enterprises and
in 2004 revised its investment code to attract foreign investment.
As a result of this new code and other legislation favoring the
mining sector, the country has seen an upswing in gold exploration
and production. By 2010, gold had become the main source of export
revenue.

Transnational Issues ::Burkina Faso




Disputes - international:


in September 2007, Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) intervened to attempt to resolve the dispute over two
villages along the Benin-Burkina Faso border that remain from a 2005
ICJ decision; in recent years citizens and rogue security forces rob
and harass local populations on both sides of the poorly defined
Burkina Faso-Niger border; despite the presence of more than 9,000
UN forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict
continues to spread into neighboring states that can no longer send
their migrant workers to work in Ivorian cocoa plantations
