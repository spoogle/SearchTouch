Estonia  (Europe)

Introduction ::Estonia




Background:


After centuries of Danish, Swedish, German, and Russian rule,
Estonia attained independence in 1918. Forcibly incorporated into
the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized by the US - it
regained its freedom in 1991 with the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Since the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to
promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. It joined
both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Economy ::Estonia




Economy - overview:


Estonia, a 2004 European Union entrant, has a modern market-based
economy and one of the higher per capita income levels in Central
Europe and the Baltic region. Estonia's successive governments have
pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda and have wavered
little in their commitment to pro-market reforms. The current
government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies that have
resulted in balanced budgets and very low public debt. The economy
benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications sectors and
strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, and Germany. Tallinn's
priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on average 8% per
year from 2003 to 2007. Estonia's economy slowed down markedly and
fell sharply into recession in mid-2008, primarily as a result of an
investment and consumption slump following the bursting of the real
estate market bubble. GDP dropped nearly 15% in 2009, among the
world's highest rates of contraction. A modest recovery began in
2010, but unemployment stands above 13%. Estonia adopted the euro in
January 2011.

Transnational Issues ::Estonia




Disputes - international:


Russia recalled its signature to the 1996 technical border agreement
with Estonia in 2005, rather than concede to Estonia's appending
prepared a unilateral declaration referencing Soviet occupation and
territorial losses; Russia demands better accommodation of
Russian-speaking population in Estonia; Estonian citizen groups
continue to press for realignment of the boundary based on the 1920
Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now divided ethnic Setu
people and parts of the Narva region within Estonia; as a member
state that forms part of the EU's external border, Estonia must
implement the strict Schengen border rules with Russia



Illicit drugs:


growing producer of synthetic drugs; increasingly important
transshipment zone for cannabis, cocaine, opiates, and synthetic
drugs since joining the European Union and the Schengen Accord;
potential money laundering related to organized crime and drug
trafficking is a concern, as is possible use of the gambling sector
to launder funds; major use of opiates and ecstasy
