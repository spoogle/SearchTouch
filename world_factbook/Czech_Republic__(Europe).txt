Czech Republic  (Europe)

Introduction ::Czech Republic




Background:


Following the First World War, the closely related Czechs and
Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form
Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders
were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic
minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and
the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II, a truncated
Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968,
an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's
leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create "socialism
with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year
ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of Soviet
authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a
peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country
underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999
and the European Union in 2004.

Economy ::Czech Republic




Economy - overview:


The Czech Republic is one of the most stable and prosperous of the
post-Communist states of Central and Eastern Europe. Maintaining an
open investment climate has been a key element of the Czech
Republic's transition from a communist, centrally planned economy to
a functioning market economy. As a member of the European Union,
with an advantageous location in the center of Europe, a relatively
low cost structure, and a well-qualified labor force, the Czech
Republic is an attractive destination for foreign investment. Prior
to its EU accession in 2004, the Czech government harmonized its
laws and regulations with those of the European Union. The small,
open, export-driven Czech economy grew by over 6% annually from
2005-2007 and by 2.5% in 2008. The conservative Czech financial
system has remained relatively healthy throughout 2009.
Nevertheless, the real economy contracted by 4.1% in 2009, mainly
due to a significant drop in external demand as the Czech Republic's
main export markets fell into recession. GDP is expected to grow by
2.4% in 2010, driven largely by a rebound in external demand,
particularly from Gremany.

Telephone system:


general assessment: privatization and modernization of the Czech
telecommunication system got a late start but is advancing steadily;
virtually all exchanges now digital; existing copper subscriber
systems enhanced with Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
equipment to accommodate Internet and other digital signals; trunk
systems include fiber-optic cable and microwave radio relay

domestic: access to the fixed-line telephone network expanded
throughout the 1990s but the number of fixed line connections has
been dropping since then; mobile telephone usage increased sharply
beginning in the mid-1990s and the number of cellular telephone
subscriptions now greatly exceeds the population
