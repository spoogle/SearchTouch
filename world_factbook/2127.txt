Field Listing :: Total fertility rate

  This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that
  would be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their
  childbearing years and bore children according to a given fertility
  rate at each age. The total fertility rate (TFR) is a more direct
  measure of the level of fertility than the crude birth rate, since
  it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows the potential
  for population change in the country. A rate of two children per
  woman is considered the replacement rate for a population, resulting
  in relative stability in terms of total numbers. Rates above two
  children indicate populations growing in size and whose median age
  is declining. Higher rates may also indicate difficulties for
  families, in some situations, to feed and educate their children and
  for women to enter the labor force. Rates below two children
  indicate populations decreasing in size and growing older. Global
  fertility rates are in general decline and this trend is most
  pronounced in industrialized countries, especially Western Europe,
  where populations are projected to decline dramatically over the
  next 50 years.
