  Economy of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots

Cyprus
  Economy - overview: The Turkish Cypriot economy has roughly
  half the per capita GDP of the south, and economic growth tends to
  be volatile, given the north's relative isolation, bloated public
  sector, reliance on the Turkish lira, and small market size.
  Agriculture and services, together, employ more than half of the
  work force. The Turkish Cypriot economy grew around 10.6% in 2006,
  fueled by growth in the construction and education sectors, as well
  as increased employment of Turkish Cypriots in the area under
  government control. GDP declined about 2.0% in 2007. The Turkish
  Cypriots are heavily dependent on transfers from the Turkish
  Government. Ankara directly finances about one-third of the "TRNC's"
  budget. Aid from Turkey has exceeded $400 million annually in recent
  years. The Turkish Cypriot economy experienced a sharp slowdown in
  2008-09 due to the global financial crisis and, because of its
  reliance on British and Turkish tourism, which has declined due to
  the recession. Turkish Cypriot finances also deteriorated in 2009 as
  decreased state revenues and increased government expenditures on
  public sector salaries and social services led to a large budget
  deficit. As tourism and the world economy picked up, the economy
  grew about 0.6% in 2010.
