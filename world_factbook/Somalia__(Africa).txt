Introduction ::Somalia




Background:


Britain withdrew from British Somaliland in 1960 to allow its
protectorate to join with Italian Somaliland and form the new nation
of Somalia. In 1969, a coup headed by Mohamed SIAD Barre ushered in
an authoritarian socialist rule characterized by the persecution,
jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents. After the
regime's collapse early in 1991, Somalia descended into turmoil,
factional fighting, and anarchy. In May 1991, northern clans
declared an independent Republic of Somaliland that now includes the
administrative regions of Awdal, Woqooyi Galbeed, Togdheer, Sanaag,
and Sool. Although not recognized by any government, this entity has
maintained a stable existence and continues efforts to establish a
constitutional democracy, including holding municipal,
parliamentary, and presidential elections. The regions of Bari,
Nugaal, and northern Mudug comprise a neighboring semi-autonomous
state of Puntland, which has been self-governing since 1998 but does
not aim at independence; it has also made strides toward
reconstructing a legitimate, representative government but has
suffered some civil strife. Puntland disputes its border with
Somaliland as it also claims portions of eastern Sool and Sanaag.
Beginning in 1993, a two-year UN humanitarian effort (primarily in
the south) was able to alleviate famine conditions, but when the UN
withdrew in 1995, having suffered significant casualties, order
still had not been restored. In 2000, the Somalia National Peace
Conference (SNPC) held in Djibouti resulted in the formation of an
interim government, known as the Transitional National Government
(TNG). When the TNG failed to establish adequate security or
governing institutions, the Government of Kenya, under the auspices
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), led a
subsequent peace process that concluded in October 2004 with the
election of Abdullahi YUSUF Ahmed as President of a second interim
government, known as the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of
the Somali Republic. The TFG included a 275-member parliamentary
body, known as the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP). President
YUSUF resigned late in 2008 while United Nations-sponsored talks
between the TFG and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of
Somalia (ARS) were underway in Djibouti. In January 2009, following
the creation of a TFG-ARS unity government, Ethiopian military
forces, which had entered Somalia in December 2006 to support the
TFG in the face of advances by the opposition Islamic Courts Union
(ICU), withdrew from the country. The TFP was increased to 550 seats
with the addition of 200 ARS and 75 civil society members of
parliament. The expanded parliament elected Sheikh SHARIF Sheikh
Ahmed, the former CIC and ARS chairman as president on 31 January
2009, in Djibouti. Subsequently, President SHARIF appointed Omar
Abdirashid ali SHARMARKE, son of a former president of Somalia, as
prime minister on 13 February 2009. SHARMARKE resigned in September
2010 and was replaced by Mohamed Abdullahi MOHAMED, aka Farmajo, a
dual US-Somali citizen that lived in the United Stated from 1985
until his return to Somalia in October 2010. The creation of the TFG
was based on the Transitional Federal Charter (TFC), which outlines
a five-year mandate leading to the establishment of a new Somali
constitution and a transition to a representative government
following national elections. However, in January 2009 the TFP
amended the TFC to extend TFG's mandate until 2011.

Economy ::Somalia




Economy - overview:


Despite the lack of effective national governance, Somalia has
maintained a healthy informal economy, largely based on livestock,
remittance/money transfer companies, and telecommunications.
Agriculture is the most important sector with livestock normally
accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50% of export
earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent upon
livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the
population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are
Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and
machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial
sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has
largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Somalia's
service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide
wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest
international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a
formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have
sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in
remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of
goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to
operate and are supported with private-security militias. Due to
armed attacks on and threats to humanitarian aid workers, the World
Food Programme partially suspended its operations in southern
Somalia in early January 2010 pending improvement in the security
situation. Somalia's arrears to the IMF have continued to grow.

Transportation - note:


the International Maritime Bureau reports the territorial and
offshore waters in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean are high risk
for piracy and armed robbery against ships; numerous vessels,
including commercial shipping and pleasure craft, have been attacked
and hijacked both at anchor and while underway; crew, passengers,
and cargo are held for ransom; the presence of several naval task
forces in the Gulf of Aden and additional anti-piracy measures on
the part of ship operators have reduced the piracy incidents; in
response local pirates shifted operations farther south along the
east coast of Somalia and eastward along the coast of Oman

Transnational Issues ::Somalia




Disputes - international:


Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia and routed Islamist Courts
from Mogadishu in January 2007; "Somaliland" secessionists provide
port facilities in Berbera to landlocked Ethiopia and have
established commercial ties with other regional states; "Puntland"
and "Somaliland" "governments" seek international support in their
secessionist aspirations and overlapping border claims; the
undemarcated former British administrative line has little meaning
as a political separation to rival clans within Ethiopia's Ogaden
and southern Somalia's Oromo region; Kenya works hard to prevent the
clan and militia fighting in Somalia from spreading south across the
border, which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 1.1 million (civil war since 1988, clan-based competition for
