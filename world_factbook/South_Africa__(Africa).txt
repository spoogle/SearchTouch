Introduction ::South Africa




Background:


Dutch traders landed at the southern tip of modern day South Africa
in 1652 and established a stopover point on the spice route between
the Netherlands and the Far East, founding the city of Cape Town.
After the British seized the Cape of Good Hope area in 1806, many of
the Dutch settlers (the Boers) trekked north to found their own
republics. The discovery of diamonds (1867) and gold (1886) spurred
wealth and immigration and intensified the subjugation of the native
inhabitants. The Boers resisted British encroachments but were
defeated in the Boer War (1899-1902); however, the British and the
Afrikaners, as the Boers became known, ruled together beginning in
1910 under the Union of South Africa, which became a republic in
1961 after a whites-only referendum. In 1948, the National Party was
voted into power and instituted a policy of apartheid - the separate
development of the races - which favored the white minority at the
expense of the black majority. The African National Congress (ANC)
led the opposition to apartheid and many top ANC leaders, such as
Nelson MANDELA, spent decades in South Africa's prisons. Internal
protests and insurgency, as well as boycotts by some Western nations
and institutions, led to the regime's eventual willingness to
negotiate a peaceful transition to majority rule. The first
multi-racial elections in 1994 brought an end to apartheid and
ushered in majority rule under an ANC-led government. South Africa
since then has struggled to address apartheid-era imbalances in
decent housing, education, and health care. ANC infighting, which
has grown in recent years, came to a head in September 2008 when
President Thabo MBEKI resigned, and Kgalema MOTLANTHE, the party's
General-Secretary, succeeded him as interim president. Jacob ZUMA
became president after the ANC won general elections in April 2009.
In January 2011, South Africa assumed a nonpermanent seat on the UN
Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

yellow bands; the red and blue bands are separated from the green
band and its arms by narrow white stripes; the flag colors do not
have any official symbolism, but the Y stands for the "convergence
of diverse elements within South African society, taking the road
ahead in unity"; black, yellow, and green are found on the flag of
the African National Congress, while red, white, and blue are the
colors in the flags of the Netherlands and the UK, whose settlers

Economy ::South Africa




Economy - overview:


South Africa is a middle-income, emerging market with an abundant
supply of natural resources; well-developed financial, legal,
communications, energy, and transport sectors; a stock exchange that
is the 18th largest in the world; and modern infrastructure
supporting a relatively efficient distribution of goods to major
urban centers throughout the region. At the end of 2007, South
Africa began to experience an electricity crisis. State power
supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants, necessitating
"load-shedding" cuts to residents and businesses in the major
cities. Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South Africa reaped
the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global commodities
boom, but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due to the
electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial crisis'
impact on commodity prices and demand. GDP fell nearly 2% in 2009.
Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has
constrained growth. Daunting economic problems remain from the
apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment
among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public
transportation. South Africa's former economic policy was fiscally
conservative, focusing on controlling inflation, and attaining a
budget surplus. The current government largely follows the same
prudent policies, but must contend with the impact of the global
crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups
to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to
low-income areas and to increase job growth. More than one-quarter
of South Africa's population currently receives social grants.

of the Congo (33,000), Somalia (20,000), Burundi (6,500), and other
states in Africa (26,000); managed dispute with Namibia over the

launderers given the increasing level of organized criminal and
narcotics activity in the region and the size of the South African
economy
