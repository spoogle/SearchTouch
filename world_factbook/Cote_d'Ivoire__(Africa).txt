Cote d'Ivoire  (Africa)

Introduction ::Cote d'Ivoire




Background:


Close ties to France since independence in 1960, the development of
cocoa production for export, and foreign investment made Cote
d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the West African states, but
did not protect it from political turmoil. In December 1999, a
military coup - the first ever in Cote d'Ivoire's history -
overthrew the government. Junta leader Robert GUEI blatantly rigged
elections held in late 2000 and declared himself the winner. Popular
protest forced him to step aside and brought Laurent GBAGBO into
power. Ivorian dissidents and disaffected members of the military
launched a failed coup attempt in September 2002. Rebel forces
claimed the northern half of the country, and in January 2003 were
granted ministerial positions in a unity government under the
auspices of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accord. President GBAGBO and
rebel forces resumed implementation of the peace accord in December
2003 after a three-month stalemate, but issues that sparked the
civil war, such as land reform and grounds for citizenship, remained
unresolved. In March 2007 President GBAGBO and former New Force
rebel leader Guillaume SORO signed the Ouagadougou Political
Agreement. As a result of the agreement, SORO joined GBAGBO's
government as Prime Minister and the two agreed to reunite the
country by dismantling the zone of confidence separating North from
South, integrate rebel forces into the national armed forces, and
hold elections. Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of
rebel forces have been problematic as rebels seek to enter the armed
forces. Citizen identification and voter registration pose election
difficulties, and balloting planned for November 2009 was postponed
with no future date set. Several thousand UN troops and several
hundred French remain in Cote d'Ivoire to help the parties implement
their commitments and to support the peace process.

Economy ::Cote d'Ivoire




Economy - overview:


Cote d'Ivoire is heavily dependent on agriculture and related
activities, which engage roughly 68% of the population. Cote
d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans
and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil.
Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
international prices for these products, and, to a lesser extent, in
climatic conditions. Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top
export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold.
Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has
continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign
investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by more than 2% in
2008 and around 4% per year in 2009-10. Per capita income has
declined by 15% since 1999, but registered a slight improvement in
2009-10. Power cuts caused by a turbine failure in early 2010 slowed
economic activity. Cote d'Ivoire in 2010 signed agreements to
restructure its Paris Club bilateral, other bilateral, and London
Club debt. Cote d'Ivoire's long term challenges include political
instability and degrading infrastructure.

Transnational Issues ::Cote d'Ivoire




Disputes - international:


despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI) in Cote
d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict still leaves displaced hundreds
of thousands of Ivorians in and out of the country as well as driven
out migrants from neighboring states who worked in Ivorian cocoa
plantations; the March 2007 peace deal between Ivorian rebels and
the government brought significant numbers of rebels out of hiding
in neighboring states



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 25,615 (Liberia)

IDPs: 709,000 (2002 coup; most IDPs are in western regions) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


Cote d'Ivoire is a source, transit, and destination country for
women and children trafficked for forced labor and commercial sexual
exploitation; trafficking within the country is more prevalent than
international trafficking and the majority of victims are children;
women and girls are trafficked from northern areas to southern
cities for domestic servitude, restaurant labor, and sexual
exploitation; boys are trafficked internally for agricultural and
service labor and transnationally for forced labor in agriculture,
mining, construction, and in the fishing industry; women and girls
are trafficked to and from other West and Central African countries
for domestic servitude and forced street vending

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cote d'Ivoire is on the Tier 2
Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
to eliminate trafficking in 2007, particularly with regard to its
law enforcement efforts and protection of sex trafficking victims;
in addition, Ivoirian law does not prohibit all forms of
trafficking, and Cote d'Ivoire has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
Protocol (2008)



Illicit drugs:


illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for local consumption; utility
as a narcotic transshipment point to Europe reduced by ongoing
political instability; while rampant corruption and inadequate
supervision leave the banking system vulnerable to money laundering,
the lack of a developed financial system limits the country's
utility as a major money-laundering center (2008)
