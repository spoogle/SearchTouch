Vanuatu  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Vanuatu




Background:


Multiple waves of colonizers, each speaking a distinct language,
migrated to the New Hebrides in the millennia preceding European
exploration in the 18th century. This settlement pattern accounts
for the complex linguistic diversity found on the archipelago to
this day. The British and French, who settled the New Hebrides in
the 19th century, agreed in 1906 to an Anglo-French Condominium,
which administered the islands until independence in 1980, when the
new name of Vanuatu was adopted.

Economy ::Vanuatu




Economy - overview:


This South Pacific island economy is based primarily on small-scale
agriculture, which provides a living for about two-thirds of the
population. Fishing, offshore financial services, and tourism, with
nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other mainstays of the economy.
Mineral deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum
deposits. A small light industry sector caters to the local market.
Tax revenues come mainly from import duties. Economic development is
hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports,
vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances from main
markets and between constituent islands. In response to foreign
concerns, the government has promised to tighten regulation of its
offshore financial center. In mid-2002, the government stepped up
efforts to boost tourism through improved air connections, resort
development, and cruise ship facilities. Agriculture, especially
livestock farming, is a second target for growth. Australia and New
Zealand are the main suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.
