Turkey  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Turkey




Background:


Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 from the Anatolian remnants of the
defeated Ottoman Empire by national hero Mustafa KEMAL, who was
later honored with the title Ataturk or "Father of the Turks." Under
his authoritarian leadership, the country adopted wide-ranging
social, legal, and political reforms. After a period of one-party
rule, an experiment with multi-party politics led to the 1950
election victory of the opposition Democratic Party and the peaceful
transfer of power. Since then, Turkish political parties have
multiplied, but democracy has been fractured by periods of
instability and intermittent military coups (1960, 1971, 1980),
which in each case eventually resulted in a return of political
power to civilians. In 1997, the military again helped engineer the
ouster - popularly dubbed a "post-modern coup" - of the then
Islamic-oriented government. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus
in 1974 to prevent a Greek takeover of the island and has since
acted as patron state to the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,"
which only Turkey recognizes. A separatist insurgency begun in 1984
by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) - now known as the People's
Congress of Kurdistan or Kongra-Gel (KGK) - has dominated the
Turkish military's attention and claimed more than 30,000 lives.
After the capture of the group's leader in 1999, the insurgents
largely withdrew from Turkey mainly to northern Iraq. In 2004, KGK
announced an end to its ceasefire and attacks attributed to the KGK
increased. Turkey joined the UN in 1945 and in 1952 it became a
member of NATO. In 1964, Turkey became an associate member of the
European Community. Over the past decade, it has undertaken many
reforms to strengthen its democracy and economy; it began accession
membership talks with the European Union in 2005.

Economy ::Turkey




Economy - overview:


Turkey's economy is increasingly driven by its industry and service
sectors, although its traditional agriculture sector still accounts
for about 30% of employment. An aggressive privatization program has
reduced state involvement in basic industry, banking, transport, and
communication, and an emerging cadre of middle-class entrepreneurs
is adding a dynamism to the economy. Turkey's traditional textiles
and clothing clothing sectors still account for one-third of
industrial employment, despite stiff competition in international
markets that resulted from the end of the global quota system. Other
sectors, notably the automotive, construction, and electronics
industries, are rising in importance and have surpassed textiles
within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone
that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to
market. Several gas pipelines also are being planned to help move
Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, which will help address
Turkey's dependence on energy imports over the long term. After
Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted
financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms
strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an
era of strong growth - averaging more than 6% annually until 2009,
when global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy slowed
growth to 4.7%, reduced inflation to 6.5% - a 34-year low - and cut
the public sector debt-to-GPD ratio below 50%. Turkey's
well-regulated financial markets and banking system weathered the
global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to 7.3% in 2010,
as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. The
economy, however, continues to be burdened by a high current account
deficit and remains dependent on often volatile, short-term
investment to finance its trade deficit. The stock value of FDI
stood at $174 billion at year-end 2010, but inflows have slowed
considerably in light of continuing economic turmoil in Europe, the
source of much of Turkey's FDI. Further economic and judicial
reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost Turkey's
attractiveness to foreign investors. However, Turkey's relatively
high current account deficit, uncertainty related to policy-making,
and fiscal imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing
shifts in investor confidence.

Military - note:


a "National Security Policy Document" adopted in October 2005
increases the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) role in internal security,
augmenting the General Directorate of Security and Gendarmerie
General Command (Jandarma); the TSK leadership continues to play a
key role in politics and considers itself guardian of Turkey's
secular state; in April 2007, it warned the ruling party about any
pro-Islamic appointments; despite on-going negotiations on EU
accession since October 2005, progress has been limited in
establishing required civilian supremacy over the military; primary
domestic threats are listed as fundamentalism (with the definition
in some dispute with the civilian government), separatism (the
Kurdish problem), and the extreme left wing; Ankara strongly opposed
establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region; an overhaul of the
Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) taking place under the "Force
2014" program is to produce 20-30% smaller, more highly trained
forces characterized by greater mobility and firepower and capable
of joint and combined operations; the TLFC has taken on increasing
international peacekeeping responsibilities, and took charge of a
NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) command in
Afghanistan in April 2007; the Turkish Navy is a regional naval
power that wants to develop the capability to project power beyond
Turkey's coastal waters; the Navy is heavily involved in NATO,
multinational, and UN operations; its roles include control of
territorial waters and security for sea lines of communications; the
Turkish Air Force adopted an "Aerospace and Missile Defense Concept"
in 2002 and has initiated project work on an integrated missile
defense system; Air Force priorities include attaining a modern
deployable, survivable, and sustainable force structure, and
establishing a sustainable command and control system (2008)







Transnational Issues ::Turkey




Disputes - international:


complex maritime, air, and territorial disputes with Greece in the
Aegean Sea; status of north Cyprus question remains; Syria and Iraq
protest Turkish hydrological projects to control upper Euphrates
waters; Turkey has expressed concern over the status of Kurds in
Iraq; border with Armenia remains closed over Nagorno-Karabakh



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 1-1.2 million (fighting 1984-99 between Kurdish PKK and
Turkish military; most IDPs in southeastern provinces) (2007)



Illicit drugs:


key transit route for Southwest Asian heroin to Western Europe and,
to a lesser extent, the US - via air, land, and sea routes; major
Turkish and other international trafficking organizations operate
out of Istanbul; laboratories to convert imported morphine base into
heroin exist in remote regions of Turkey and near Istanbul;
government maintains strict controls over areas of legal opium poppy
cultivation and over output of poppy straw concentrate; lax
enforcement of money-laundering controls
