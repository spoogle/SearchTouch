Pakistan  (South Asia)

Introduction ::Pakistan




Background:


The Indus Valley civilization, one of the oldest in the world and
dating back at least 5,000 years, spread over much of what is
presently Pakistan. During the second millennium B.C., remnants of
this culture fused with the migrating Indo-Aryan peoples. The area
underwent successive invasions in subsequent centuries from the
Persians, Greeks, Scythians, Arabs (who brought Islam), Afghans, and
Turks. The Mughal Empire flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries;
the British came to dominate the region in the 18th century. The
separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of
Pakistan (with West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was
never satisfactorily resolved, and India and Pakistan fought two
wars - in 1947-48 and 1965 - over the disputed Kashmir territory. A
third war between these countries in 1971 - in which India
capitalized on Islamabad's marginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani
politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of
Bangladesh. In response to Indian nuclear weapons testing, Pakistan
conducted its own tests in 1998. India-Pakistan relations have been
rocky since the November 2008 Mumbai attacks, but both countries are
taking small steps to put relations back on track. In February 2008,
Pakistan held parliamentary elections and in September 2008, after
the resignation of former President MUSHARRAF, elected Asif Ali
ZARDARI to the presidency. Pakistani government and military leaders
are struggling to control domestic insurgents, many of whom are
located in the tribal areas adjacent to the border with Afghanistan.

Economy ::Pakistan




Economy - overview:


Pakistan, an impoverished and underdeveloped country, has suffered
from decades of internal political disputes and low levels of
foreign investment. Between 2001-07, however, poverty levels
decreased by 10%, as Islamabad steadily raised development spending.
Between 2004-07, GDP growth in the 5-8% range was spurred by gains
in the industrial and service sectors - despite severe electricity
shortfalls - but growth slowed in 2008-09 and unemployment rose.
Inflation remains the top concern among the public, climbing from
7.7% in 2007 to more than 13% in 2010. In addition, the Pakistani
rupee has depreciated since 2007 as a result of political and
economic instability. The government agreed to an International
Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a
balance of payments crisis, but during 2009-10 its current account
strengthened and foreign exchange reserves stabilized - largely
because of lower oil prices and record remittances from workers
abroad. Record floods in July-August 2010 lowered agricultural
output and contributed to a jump in inflation, and reconstruction
costs will strain the limited resources of the government. Textiles
account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, but Pakistan's
failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has
left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Other long
term challenges include expanding investment in education,
healthcare, and electricity production, and reducing dependence on
foreign donors.

the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with
portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin),
India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern
Areas); UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)
has maintained a small group of peacekeepers since 1949; India does
not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic Kashmir lands to China in
1964; India and Pakistan have maintained their 2004 cease fire in
Kashmir and initiated discussions on defusing the armed stand-off in
the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan protests India's fencing the
highly militarized Line of Control and construction of the Baglihar
Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and Kashmir, which is part of the
larger dispute on water sharing of the Indus River and its
tributaries; to defuse tensions and prepare for discussions on a
maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek technical resolution of
the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary at the mouth of the Rann
of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani maps continue to show the
Junagadh claim in India's Gujarat State; by 2005, Pakistan, with UN
assistance, repatriated 2.3 million Afghan refugees leaving slightly
more than a million, many of whom remain at their own choosing;
Pakistan has proposed and Afghanistan protests construction of a
fence and laying of mines along portions of their porous border;
Pakistan has sent troops into remote tribal areas to monitor and
control the border with Afghanistan and to stem terrorist or other
illegal activities
