Niger  (Africa)

Introduction ::Niger




Background:


Niger became independent from France in 1960 and experienced
single-party and military rule until 1991, when Gen. Ali SAIBOU was
forced by public pressure to allow multiparty elections, which
resulted in a democratic government in 1993. Political infighting
brought the government to a standstill and in 1996 led to a coup by
Col. Ibrahim BARE. In 1999, BARE was killed in a counter coup by
military officers who restored democratic rule and held elections
that brought Mamadou TANDJA to power in December of that year.
TANDJA was reelected in 2004 and in 2009 spearheaded a
constitutional amendment that would allow him to extend his term as
president. In February 2010, a military coup deposed TANDJA,
immediately suspended the constitution and dissolved the Cabinet,
and promised that elections would be held following a transitional
period of unspecified duration. Niger is one of the poorest
countries in the world with minimal government services and
insufficient funds to develop its resource base. The largely
agrarian and subsistence-based economy is frequently disrupted by
extended droughts common to the Sahel region of Africa. A
predominately Tuareg ethnic group emerged in February 2007, the
Nigerien Movement for Justice (MNJ), and attacked several military
targets in Niger's northern region throughout 2007 and 2008.
Successful government offensives in 2009 limited the rebels'
operational capabilities.

Economy ::Niger




Economy - overview:


Niger is a landlocked, Sub-Saharan nation, whose economy centers on
subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest
uranium deposits. Drought, desertification, and strong population
growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common currency,
the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank of West
African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West African
Monetary Union. In December 2000, Niger qualified for enhanced debt
relief under the International Monetary Fund program for Highly
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement with the
Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF). Debt relief
provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative significantly reduces
Niger's annual debt service obligations, freeing funds for
expenditures on basic health care, primary education, HIV/AIDS
prevention, rural infrastructure, and other programs geared at
poverty reduction. In December 2005, Niger received 100%
multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which translates into the
forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in debts to the IMF,
excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. In 2010, the Niger
economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009 drought that
reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated livestock herds.
The economy was also hurt when the international community cut off
non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA's moves to extend his
term as president. Nearly half of the government's budget is derived
from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be sustained by
exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral resources.

Transnational Issues ::Niger




Disputes - international:


Libya claims about 25,000 sq km in a currently dormant dispute in
the Tommo region; much of Benin-Niger boundary, including tripoint
with Nigeria, remains undemarcated; only Nigeria and Cameroon have
heeded the Lake Chad Commission's admonition to ratify the
delimitation treaty that also includes the Chad-Niger and
Niger-Nigeria boundaries



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Niger is a source, transit, and destination
country for children and women trafficked for forced labor and
sexual exploitation; caste-based slavery practices, rooted in
ancestral master-slave relationships, continue in isolated areas of
the country - an estimated 8,800 to 43,000 Nigeriens live under
conditions of traditional slavery; children are trafficked within
Niger for forced begging, forced labor in gold mines, domestic
servitude, sexual exploitation, and possibly for forced labor in
agriculture and stone quarries; women and children from neighboring
states are trafficked to and through Niger for domestic servitude,
sexual exploitation, forced labor in mines and on farms, and as
mechanics and welders

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Niger does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking and is not making any significant efforts to do so; the
government demonstrated marginal efforts to combat human
trafficking, including traditional slavery, during the last year
(2009)
