West Bank  (Middle East)

Introduction ::West Bank




Background:


The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Under a
series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999,
Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and
civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the permanent
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following the
outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the
Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final
settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the
two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic
Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late
2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month
later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments
in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,
Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and
dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew
settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank
settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,
and most access to the Gaza Strip. In January 2006, the Islamic
Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government
in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating
with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the
international community so as to lift economic sanctions on
Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in
the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous
Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS
Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi
Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National
Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.
However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,
HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and
governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG
and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government
in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the
NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered
reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge
their differences. The status quo remains with HAMAS in control of
the Gaza Strip and ABBAS and the Fatah-dominated PA governing the
West Bank. FAYYAD and his PA government continue to implement a
series of security and economic reforms to improve conditions in the
West Bank. ABBAS has said he will not resume negotiations with
current Prime Minister NETANYAHU until Israel halts all settlement
activity in the West Bank and Jerusalem.

Economy - overview:


The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the
Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic
growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid, the
Palestinian Authority's (PA) implementation of economic and security
reforms, and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by
the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, overall standard-of-living
measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second
intifada in 2000. The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a
result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement
and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli
security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows,
industrial capacity, and basic commerce, both external and internal.
Since 2008, the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister
Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of
institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and
economic performance, supported by more than $3 billion in direct
foreign donor assistance to the PA's budget since 2007. An easing of
some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since
2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger
cities. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West
Bank remain Palestinians' lack of access to land and resources in
Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a
high-cost capital structure. Absent robust private sector growth,
the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary
needs.
