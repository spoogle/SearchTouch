Jersey  (Europe)

Introduction ::Jersey




Background:


Jersey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants of
the medieval Dukedom of Normandy that held sway in both France and
England. These islands were the only British soil occupied by German
troops in World War II. Jersey is a British crown dependency but is
not part of the UK or of the European Union. However, the UK
Government is constitutionally responsible for its defense and
international representation.

Flag description:


white with a diagonal red cross extending to the corners of the
flag; in the upper quadrant, surmounted by a yellow crown, a red
shield with three lions in yellow; according to tradition, the ships
of Jersey - in an attempt to differentiate themselves from English
ships flying the horizontal cross of St. George - rotated the cross
to the "X" (saltire) configuration; because this arrangement still
resembled the Irish cross of St. Patrick, the yellow Plantagenet
crown and Jersey coat of arms were added

Economy ::Jersey




Economy - overview:


Jersey's economy is based on international financial services,
agriculture, and tourism. In 2005 the finance sector accounted for
about 50% of the island's output. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes,
and especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to
the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and
represents an important export income earner. Milk products go to
the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts for one-quarter of
GDP. In recent years, the government has encouraged light industry
to locate in Jersey with the result that an electronics industry has
developed, displacing more traditional industries. All raw material
and energy requirements are imported as well as a large share of
Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death duties make the island a
popular tax haven. Living standards come close to those of the UK.
