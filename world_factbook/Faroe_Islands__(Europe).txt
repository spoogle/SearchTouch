Faroe Islands  (Europe)

Introduction ::Faroe Islands




Background:


The population of the Faroe Islands is largely descended from Viking
settlers who arrived in the 9th century. The islands have been
connected politically to Denmark since the 14th century. A high
degree of self government was granted the Faroese in 1948, who have
autonomy over most internal affairs while Denmark is responsible for
justice, defense, and foreign affairs. The Faroe Islands are not
part of the European Union.

Economy ::Faroe Islands




Economy - overview:


The Faroese economy is dependent on fishing, which makes the economy
vulnerable to price swings. The sector accounts for about 95% of
exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the Faroese economy
began to slow as a result of smaller catches and historically high
oil prices that continue to trouble the economy. Though oil prices
have come down, reduced catches, especially of cod and haddock, have
continued to strain the Faroese economy. GDP grew 0.5% in 2008-09.
The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a strong performance
since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates averaging close to 6%,
mostly a result of increased fish landings and salmon farming, and
high export prices. Unemployment reached its lowest level in the
first half of 2008, but increased to 3.9% in 2009 and is rising. The
Faroese Home Rule Government produced increasing budget surpluses
that helped to reduce the large public debt, most of it to Denmark.
However, total dependence on fishing and salmon farming make the
Faroese economy very vulnerable to fluctuations in world demand. In
addition, budget surpluses turned to deficits in 2008-09, and the
economy at both the country and local level is running large
deficits. Initial discoveries of oil in the Faroese area give hope
for eventual oil production, which may provide a foundation for a
more diversified economy and less dependence on Danish economic
assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy from Denmark amounting to
about 6% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have a standard of living
almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland.
