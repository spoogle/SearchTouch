United States  (North America)

Introduction ::United States




Background:


Britain's American colonies broke with the mother country in 1776
and were recognized as the new nation of the United States of
America following the Treaty of Paris in 1783. During the 19th and
20th centuries, 37 new states were added to the original 13 as the
nation expanded across the North American continent and acquired a
number of overseas possessions. The two most traumatic experiences
in the nation's history were the Civil War (1861-65), in which a
northern Union of states defeated a secessionist Confederacy of 11
southern slave states, and the Great Depression of the 1930s, an
economic downturn during which about a quarter of the labor force
lost its jobs. Buoyed by victories in World Wars I and II and the
end of the Cold War in 1991, the US remains the world's most
powerful nation state. Over a span of more than five decades, the
economy has achieved steady growth, low unemployment and inflation,
and rapid advances in technology.

Maritime claims:


territorial sea: 12 nm

contiguous zone: 24 nm

exclusive economic zone: 200 nm

continental shelf: not specified



Climate:


mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida, arctic in
Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi River,
and arid in the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter
temperatures in the northwest are ameliorated occasionally in
January and February by warm chinook winds from the eastern slopes
of the Rocky Mountains



Terrain:


vast central plain, mountains in west, hills and low mountains in
east; rugged mountains and broad river valleys in Alaska; rugged,
volcanic topography in Hawaii



Elevation extremes:


lowest point: Death Valley -86 m

highest point: Mount McKinley 6,194 m

note: the peak of Mauna Kea (4,207 m above sea level) on the island
of Hawaii rises about 10,200 m above the Pacific Ocean floor; by
this measurement, it is the world's tallest mountain - higher than
Mount Everest, which is recognized as the tallest mountain above sea
level



Natural resources:


coal, copper, lead, molybdenum, phosphates, rare earth elements,
uranium, bauxite, gold, iron, mercury, nickel, potash, silver,
tungsten, zinc, petroleum, natural gas, timber

note: the US has the world's largest coal reserves with 491 billion
short tons accounting for 27% of the world's total



Land use:


arable land: 18.01%

permanent crops: 0.21%

other: 81.78% (2005)



Irrigated land:


223,850 sq km (2003)



Total renewable water resources:


3,069 cu km (1985)

total: 477 cu km/yr (13%/46%/41%)

per capita: 1,600 cu m/yr (2000)



Natural hazards:


tsunamis; volcanoes; earthquake activity around Pacific Basin;
hurricanes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts; tornadoes
in the Midwest and Southeast; mud slides in California; forest fires
in the west; flooding; permafrost in northern Alaska, a major
impediment to development

volcanism: the United States experiences volcanic activity in the
Hawaiian Islands, Western Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, and in the
Northern Mariana Islands; both Mauna Loa (elev. 4,170 m, 13,678 ft)
in Hawaii and Mount Rainier (elev. 4,392 m, 14,409 ft) in Washington
have been deemed "Decade Volcanoes" by the International Association
of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of
study due to their explosive history and close proximity to human
populations; Pavlof (elev. 2,519 m, 8,264 ft) is the most active
volcano in Alaska's Aleutian Arc and poses a significant threat to
air travel since the area constitutes a major flight path between
North America and East Asia; St. Helens (elev. 2,549 m, 8,363 ft),
famous for the devastating 1980 eruption, remains active today;
numerous other historically active volcanoes exist, mostly
concentrated in the Aleutian arc and Hawaii; they include: in
Alaska: Aniakchak, Augustine, Chiginagak, Fourpeaked, Iliamna,
Katmai, Kupreanof, Martin, Novarupta, Redoubt, Spurr, Wrangell; in
Hawaii: Trident, Ugashik-Peulik, Ukinrek Maars, Veniaminof; in the
Northern Mariana Islands: Anatahan; and in the Pacific Northwest:
Mount Baker, Mount Hood



Environment - current issues:


air pollution resulting in acid rain in both the US and Canada; the
US is the largest single emitter of carbon dioxide from the burning
of fossil fuels; water pollution from runoff of pesticides and
fertilizers; limited natural fresh water resources in much of the
western part of the country require careful management;
desertification

Economy ::United States




Economy - overview:


The US has the largest and most technologically powerful economy in
the world, with a per capita GDP of $47,400. In this market-oriented
economy, private individuals and business firms make most of the
decisions, and the federal and state governments buy needed goods
and services predominantly in the private marketplace. US business
firms enjoy greater flexibility than their counterparts in Western
Europe and Japan in decisions to expand capital plant, to lay off
surplus workers, and to develop new products. At the same time, they
face higher barriers to enter their rivals' home markets than
foreign firms face entering US markets. US firms are at or near the
forefront in technological advances, especially in computers and in
medical, aerospace, and military equipment; their advantage has
narrowed since the end of World War II. The onrush of technology
largely explains the gradual development of a "two-tier labor
market" in which those at the bottom lack the education and the
professional/technical skills of those at the top and, more and
more, fail to get comparable pay raises, health insurance coverage,
and other benefits. Since 1975, practically all the gains in
household income have gone to the top 20% of households. The war in
March-April 2003 between a US-led coalition and Iraq, and the
subsequent occupation of Iraq, required major shifts in national
resources to the military. Soaring oil prices between 2005 and the
first half of 2008 threatened inflation and unemployment, as higher
gasoline prices ate into consumers' budgets. Imported oil accounts
for about 60% of US consumption. Long-term problems include
inadequate investment in economic infrastructure, rapidly rising
medical and pension costs of an aging population, sizable trade and
budget deficits, and stagnation of family income in the lower
economic groups. The merchandise trade deficit reached a record $840
billion in 2008 before shrinking to $506 billion in 2009, and
ramping back up to $630 billion in 2010. The global economic
downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, investment bank failures,
falling home prices, and tight credit pushed the United States into
a recession by mid-2008. GDP contracted until the third quarter of
2009, making this the deepest and longest downturn since the Great
Depression. To help stabilize financial markets, the US Congress
established a $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in
October 2008. The government used some of these funds to purchase
equity in US banks and other industrial corporations, much of which
had been returned to the government by early 2011. In January 2009
the US Congress passed and President Barack OBAMA signed a bill
providing an additional $787 billion fiscal stimulus to be used over
10 years - two-thirds on additional spending and one-third on tax
cuts - to create jobs and to help the economy recover. Approximately
two-thirds of these funds were injected into the economy by the end
of 2010. In March 2010, President OBAMA signed a health insurance
reform bill into law that will extend coverage to an additional 32
million American citizens by 2016, through private health insurance
for the general population and Medicaid for the impoverished. In
July 2010, the president signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act, a bill designed to promote financial
stability by protecting consumers from financial abuses, ending
taxpayer bailouts of financial firms, dealing with troubled banks
that are "too big to fail," and improving accountability and
transparency in the financial system - in particular, by requiring
certain financial derivatives to be traded in markets that are
subject to government regulation and oversight. In late 2010, the US
Federal Reserve Bank (The Fed) announced that it would purchase $600
billion worth of US Government bonds by June 2011, in an attempt to
keep interest rates from rising and snuffing out the nascent
recovery.
