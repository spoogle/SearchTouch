Gambia, The  (Africa)

Introduction ::Gambia, The




Background:


The Gambia gained its independence from the UK in 1965.
Geographically surrounded by Senegal, it formed a short-lived
federation of Senegambia between 1982 and 1989. In 1991 the two
nations signed a friendship and cooperation treaty, but tensions
have flared up intermittently since then. Yahya A. J. J. JAMMEH led
a military coup in 1994 that overthrew the president and banned
political activity. A new constitution and presidential elections in
1996, followed by parliamentary balloting in 1997, completed a
nominal return to civilian rule. JAMMEH has been elected president
in all subsequent elections including most recently in late 2006.

Economy ::Gambia, The




Economy - overview:


The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a limited
agricultural base, and relies in part on remittances from workers
overseas and tourist receipts. About three-quarters of the
population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood.
Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of
peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity
to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West
Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in
eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In the past few years, The
Gambia's re-export trade - traditionally a major segment of economic
activity - has declined, but its banking sector has grown rapidly.
Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high; economic
progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on
responsible government economic management, and on continued
technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. The
quality of fiscal management, however, is weak. The government has
promised to raise civil service wages over the next two years and
the deficit is projected to worsen.
