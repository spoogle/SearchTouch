Introduction ::Guinea-Bissau




Background:


Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has
experienced considerable political and military upheaval. In 1980, a
military coup established authoritarian dictator Joao Bernardo
'Nino' VIEIRA as president. Despite setting a path to a market
economy and multiparty system, VIEIRA's regime was characterized by
the suppression of political opposition and the purging of political
rivals. Several coup attempts through the 1980s and early 1990s
failed to unseat him. In 1994 VIEIRA was elected president in the
country's first free elections. A military mutiny and resulting
civil war in 1998 eventually led to VIEIRA's ouster in May 1999. In
February 2000, a transitional government turned over power to
opposition leader Kumba YALA after he was elected president in
transparent polling. In September 2003, after only three years in
office, YALA was ousted by the military in a bloodless coup, and
businessman Henrique ROSA was sworn in as interim president. In
2005, former President VIEIRA was re-elected president pledging to
pursue economic development and national reconciliation; he was
assassinated in March 2009. Malam Bacai SANHA was elected in an
emergency election held in June 2009.

Economy ::Guinea-Bissau




Economy - overview:


One of the poorest countries in the world, Guinea-Bissau's legal
economy depends mainly on farming and fishing, but trafficking
narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade. Cashew crops have
increased remarkably in recent years. Guinea-Bissau exports fish and
seafood along with small amounts of peanuts, palm kernels, and
timber. Rice is the major crop and staple food. However,
intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed government troops
and a military junta destroyed much of the country's infrastructure
and caused widespread damage to the economy in 1998; the civil war
led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with partial recovery in
1999-2002. In December 2003, the World Bank, IMF, and UNDP were
forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary support in the
amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over 80% of the total
national budget. The combination of limited economic prospects, a
weak and faction-ridden government, and favorable geography have
made this West African country a way station for drugs bound for
Europe.

and arms smuggling into Guinea-Bissau



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 7,454 (Senegal) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Guinea-Bissau is a source country for children
trafficked primarily for forced begging and forced agricultural
labor to other West African countries

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for the second year in a row,
Guinea-Bissau is on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to combat
severe forms of trafficking in persons, as evidenced by the
continued failure to pass an anti-trafficking law and inadequate
efforts to investigate or prosecute trafficking crimes or convict
and punish trafficking offenders (2008)



Illicit drugs:


increasingly important transit country for South American cocaine
enroute to Europe; enabling environment for trafficker operations
thanks to pervasive corruption; archipelago-like geography around
the capital facilitates drug smuggling
