Togo  (Africa)

Introduction ::Togo




Background:


French Togoland became Togo in 1960. Gen. Gnassingbe EYADEMA,
installed as military ruler in 1967, ruled Togo with a heavy hand
for almost four decades. Despite the facade of multiparty elections
instituted in the early 1990s, the government was largely dominated
by President EYADEMA, whose Rally of the Togolese People (RPT) party
has maintained power almost continually since 1967 and maintains a
majority of seats in today's legislature. Upon EYADEMA's death in
February 2005, the military installed the president's son, Faure
GNASSINGBE, and then engineered his formal election two months
later. Democratic gains since then allowed Togo to hold its first
relatively free and fair legislative elections in October 2007.
After years of political unrest and condemnation from international
organizations for human rights abuses, Togo is finally being
re-welcomed into the international community.

Economy ::Togo




Economy - overview:


This small, sub-Saharan economy suffers from anemic economic growth
and depends heavily on both commercial and subsistence agriculture,
which provides employment for 65% of the labor force. Some basic
foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and cotton
generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the most
important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest producer of
phosphate. The government's decade-long effort, supported by the
World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic reform measures,
encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in line with
expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on follow through on
privatization, increased openness in government financial
operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued
support from foreign donors. Togo is on track with its IMF Extended
Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in
2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven. Economic
growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production
and underinvestment in phosphate mining.
