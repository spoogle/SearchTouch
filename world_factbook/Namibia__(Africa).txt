Namibia  (Africa)

Introduction ::Namibia




Background:


South Africa occupied the German colony of South-West Africa during
World War I and administered it as a mandate until after World War
II, when it annexed the territory. In 1966 the Marxist South-West
Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrilla group launched a war
of independence for the area that became Namibia, but it was not
until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its administration in
accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. Namibia has
been governed by SWAPO since the country won independence in 1990.
Hifikepunye POHAMBA was elected president in November 2004 in a
landslide victory replacing Sam NUJOMA who led the country during
its first 14 years of self rule. POHAMBA was reelected in November
2009.

Economy ::Namibia




Economy - overview:


The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and processing of
minerals for export. Mining accounts for 8% of GDP, but provides
more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich alluvial diamond
deposits make Namibia a primary source for gem-quality diamonds.
Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in
Africa, the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium, and the
producer of large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and
tungsten. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the population
while about 35-40% of the population depends on subsistence
agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports about 50%
of its cereal requirements; in drought years food shortages are a
major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP, relative to the
region, hides one of the world's most unequal income distributions,
as shown by Namibia's GINI coefficient. The Namibian economy is
closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar pegged
one-to-one to the South African rand. Until 2010, Namibia drew 40%
of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU). Increased payments from SACU put Namibia's budget into
surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence. SACU
allotments to Namibia increased in 2009, but will drop for 2010 and
2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global
economic crisis, reducing overall SACU income. Increased fish
production and mining of zinc, copper, uranium, and silver spurred
growth in 2003-08, but growth in recent years was undercut by poor
fish catches, higher costs of producing metals, and the global
recession.

the location of the boundary in the Orange River; Namibia has
supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections to, plans between
Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi River,
thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly delimited,
Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river
