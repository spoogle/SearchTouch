Gabon  (Africa)

Introduction ::Gabon




Background:


Until recently, only two autocratic presidents had ruled Gabon since
its independence from France in 1960. The recent president of Gabon,
El Hadj Omar BONGO Ondimba - one of the longest-serving heads of
state in the world - had dominated the country's political scene for
four decades. President BONGO introduced a nominal multiparty system
and a new constitution in the early 1990s. However, allegations of
electoral fraud during local elections in 2002-03 and the
presidential elections in 2005 exposed the weaknesses of formal
political structures in Gabon. President BONGO died in June 2009.
New elections in August 2009 brought Ali Ben BONGO, son of the
former president, to power. Despite political conditions, a small
population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign
support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous and stable
African countries. In January 2010, Gabon assumed a nonpermanent
seat on the UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.

Economy ::Gabon




Economy - overview:


Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan
African nations, but because of high income inequality, a large
proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on timber
and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early 1970s.
The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP although the
industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production. Gabon
continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and
manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction
of 1.4% in 2009. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor
fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997, an IMF mission to
Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget
items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its
schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of
oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but drops in production
have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon
signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and
later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a
sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.

forced market vending, forced restaurant labor, and sexual
exploitation, while boys are trafficked for forced street hawking
and forced labor in small workshops

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Gabon is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat
human trafficking in 2007, particularly in terms of efforts to
convict and punish trafficking offenders; the government has not
reported the convictions or sentences of any trafficking offenders;
the government did not take steps to reduce demand for commercial
sex acts (2008)
