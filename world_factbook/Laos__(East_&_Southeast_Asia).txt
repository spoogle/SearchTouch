Laos  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Laos




Background:


Modern-day Laos has its roots in the ancient Lao kingdom of Lan
Xang, established in the 14th Century under King FA NGUM. For 300
years Lan Xang had influence reaching into present-day Cambodia and
Thailand, as well as over all of what is now Laos. After centuries
of gradual decline, Laos came under the domination of Siam
(Thailand) from the late 18th century until the late 19th century
when it became part of French Indochina. The Franco-Siamese Treaty
of 1907 defined the current Lao border with Thailand. In 1975, the
Communist Pathet Lao took control of the government ending a
six-century-old monarchy and instituting a strict socialist regime
closely aligned to Vietnam. A gradual, limited return to private
enterprise and the liberalization of foreign investment laws began
in 1988. Laos became a member of ASEAN in 1997. In late 2009,
Thailand returned to Laos about 3,000 Hmong residing in refugee
camps.

Economy ::Laos




Economy - overview:


The government of Laos, one of the few remaining one-party Communist
states, began decentralizing control and encouraging private
enterprise in 1986. The results, starting from an extremely low
base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008
except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial
crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos
remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure,
particularly in rural areas. It has a rudimentary, but improving,
road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications.
Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts.
Subsistence agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland
areas, accounts for about 30% of GDP and provides 80% of total
employment. The government in FY08/09 received $560 million from
international donors. Economic growth has reduced official poverty
rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2009. The economy has benefited
from high foreign investment in hydropower, mining, and
construction. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US
in 2004, and is taking steps required to join the World Trade
Organization, such as reforming import licensing. Related trade
policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal
side, Laos launched an effort to ensure the collection of taxes in
2009 as the global economic slowdown reduced revenues from mining
projects. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits
for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Lao's
economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the
country's profile among investors. The World Bank has declared that
Laos's goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of
least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable. According Laotian
officials, the 7th Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011-15 will
outline efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals.

Military - note:


serving one of the world's least developed countries, the Lao
People's Armed Forces (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and
ineffectively resourced; its mission focus is border and internal
security, primarily in countering ethnic Hmong insurgent groups;
together with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the
government, the Lao People's Army (LPA) is the third pillar of state
machinery, and as such is expected to suppress political and civil
unrest and similar national emergencies, but the LPA also has
upgraded skills to respond to avian influenza outbreaks; there is no
perceived external threat to the state and the LPA maintains strong
ties with the neighboring Vietnamese military (2008)
