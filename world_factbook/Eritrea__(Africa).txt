Eritrea  (Africa)

Introduction ::Eritrea




Background:


The UN awarded Eritrea to Ethiopia in 1952 as part of a federation.
Ethiopia's annexation of Eritrea as a province 10 years later
sparked a 30-year struggle for independence that ended in 1991 with
Eritrean rebels defeating governmental forces; independence was
overwhelmingly approved in a 1993 referendum. A two-and-a-half-year
border war with Ethiopia that erupted in 1998 ended under UN
auspices in December 2000. Eritrea hosted a UN peacekeeping
operation that monitored a 25 km-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ)
on the border with Ethiopia. Eritrea's denial of fuel to the mission
caused the UN to withdraw the mission and terminate its mandate 31
July 2008. An international commission, organized to resolve the
border dispute, posted its findings in 2002. However, both parties
have been unable to reach agreement on implementing the decision. On
30 November 2007, the Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission remotely
demarcated the border by coordinates and dissolved itself, leaving
Ethiopia still occupying several tracts of disputed territory,
including the town of Badme. Eritrea accepted the EEBC's "virtual
demarcation" decision and called on Ethiopia to remove its troops
from the TSZ that it states is Eritrean territory. Ethiopia has not
accepted the virtual demarcation decision. In 2009 the UN imposed
sanctions on Eritrea after accusing it of backing anti-Ethiopian
Islamist insurgents in Somalia.

Economy ::Eritrea




Economy - overview:


Since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has faced the
economic problems of a small, desperately poor country, accentuated
by the recent implementation of restrictive economic policies.
Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the sole
political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice
(PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of
the population - nearly 80% - is engaged in subsistence agriculture,
but they produce only a small share of total output. Since the
conclusion of the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 2000, the government has
maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the
military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's
development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of
foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private
enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on
taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the
delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military
continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's
recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the
country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional
revenue on the development of several international mining projects.
Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the
Eritrean Government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract
with the government in 2007 and began mineral extraction in 2010.
Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social
problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills, and more
importantly, on the government's willingness to support a true
market economy.

Transnational Issues ::Eritrea




Disputes - international:


Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by 2002 Ethiopia-Eritrea
Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision but, neither
party responded to the revised line detailed in the November 2006
EEBC Demarcation Statement; Sudan accuses Eritrea of supporting
eastern Sudanese rebel groups; in 2008 Eritrean troops move across
the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupy Doumera Island with
undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 32,000 (border war with Ethiopia from 1998-2000; most IDPs are
near the central border region) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Eritrea is a source country for men, women, and
children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial
sexual exploitation; each year, large numbers of migrant workers
depart Eritrea in search of work, particularly in the Gulf States,
where some likely become victims of forced labor, including in
domestic servitude, or commercial sexual exploitation; thousands of
Eritreans flee the country illegally, mostly to Sudan, Ethiopia, and
Kenya where their illegal status makes them vulnerable to situations
of human trafficking; the government remains complicit in
conscripting children into military service

tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Eritrea does not fully
comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
and is not making significant efforts to do so; the Eritrean
government does not operate with transparency and published neither
data nor statistics regarding its efforts to combat human
trafficking; it did not respond to requests to provide information
for this report; the government made no known progress in
prosecuting and punishing trafficking crimes over the reporting
period and did not appear to provide any significant assistance to
victims of trafficking during the reporting period (2009)
