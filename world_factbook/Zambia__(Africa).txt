Zambia  (Africa)

Introduction ::Zambia




Background:


The territory of Northern Rhodesia was administered by the [British]
South Africa Company from 1891 until it was taken over by the UK in
1923. During the 1920s and 1930s, advances in mining spurred
development and immigration. The name was changed to Zambia upon
independence in 1964. In the 1980s and 1990s, declining copper
prices and a prolonged drought hurt the economy. Elections in 1991
brought an end to one-party rule, but the subsequent vote in 1996
saw blatant harassment of opposition parties. The election in 2001
was marked by administrative problems with three parties filing a
legal petition challenging the election of ruling party candidate
Levy MWANAWASA. The new president launched an anticorruption
investigation in 2002 to probe high-level corruption during the
previous administration. In 2006-07, this task force successfully
prosecuted four cases, including a landmark civil case in the UK in
which former President CHILUBA and numerous others were found liable
for USD 41 million. MWANAWASA was reelected in 2006 in an election
that was deemed free and fair. Upon his abrupt death in August 2008,
he was succeeded by his Vice President Rupiah BANDA, who
subsequently won a special presidential election in October 2008.

Economy ::Zambia




Economy - overview:


Zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent years, with
real GDP growth in 2005-08 about 6% per year. Privatization of
government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved the government
from covering mammoth losses generated by the industry and greatly
improved the chances for copper mining to return to profitability
and spur economic growth. Copper output has increased steadily since
2004, due to higher copper prices and foreign investment. In 2005,
Zambia qualified for debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor
Country Initiative, consisting of approximately USD 6 billion in
debt relief. Poverty remains a significant problem in Zambia,
despite a stronger economy. Declining world commodity prices and
demand slowed GDP growth in 2008, but a sharp rebound in copper
prices and a bumper maize crop helped Zambia recover. Lack of
economic diversity subjects Zambia to fluctuations in copper prices
and in the weather.
