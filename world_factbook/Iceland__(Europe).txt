Iceland  (Europe)

Introduction ::Iceland




Background:


Settled by Norwegian and Celtic (Scottish and Irish) immigrants
during the late 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Iceland boasts the
world's oldest functioning legislative assembly, the Althing,
established in 930. Independent for over 300 years, Iceland was
subsequently ruled by Norway and Denmark. Fallout from the Askja
volcano of 1875 devastated the Icelandic economy and caused
widespread famine. Over the next quarter century, 20% of the
island's population emigrated, mostly to Canada and the US. Limited
home rule from Denmark was granted in 1874 and complete independence
attained in 1944. The second half of the 20th century saw
substantial economic growth driven primarily by the fishing
industry. The economy diversified greatly after the country joined
the European Economic Area in 1994, but Iceland was especially hard
hit by the global financial crisis in the years following 2008.
Literacy, longevity, and social cohesion are first rate by world
standards.

volcanism: Iceland, situated on top of a hotspot, experiences severe
volcanic activity; Eyjafjallajokull (elev. 1,666 m, 5,466 ft)
erupted in 2010, sending ash high into the atmosphere and seriously
disrupting European air traffic; scientists continue to monitor
nearby Katla (elev. 1,512 m, 4,961 ft), which has a high probability
of eruption in the very near future, potentially disrupting air
traffic; Grimsvotn and Hekla are Iceland's most frequently active
volcanoes; other historically active volcanoes include Askja,
Bardarbunga, Brennisteinsfjoll, Esjufjoll, Hengill, Krafla,

Economy ::Iceland




Economy - overview:


Iceland's Scandinavian-type social-market economy combines a
capitalist structure and free-market principles with an extensive
welfare system. Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high
growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of
income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which
provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs
7% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks
as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports:
fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's
economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service
industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of
software production, biotechnology, and tourism. Abundant geothermal
and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment
in the aluminum sector and boosted economic growth, although the
financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much
of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a
boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the
country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in
foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in
foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking
sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions
throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona
vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic
banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the
country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks
collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in
loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and
financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign
deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment
peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. GDP fell 3.4% in 2010. Since the
collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic
priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, reducing Iceland's
high budget deficit, containing inflation, restructuring the
financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were
established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks.
Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a
majority of the shares of the third. British and Dutch authorities
have pressed claims totaling over $5 billion against Iceland to
compensate their citizens for losses suffered on deposits held in
the failed Icelandic bank, Landsbanki Islands. Iceland agreed to new
terms with the UK and the Netherlands to compensate British and
Dutch depositors, but the agreement must first be approved by the
Icelandic President. Iceland began EU accession negotiations with
the EU in July 2010, however, public support has dropped
substantially because of concern about losing control over fishing
resources and in reaction to measures taken by Brussels during the
ongoing Eurozone crisis.

Telephone system:


general assessment: telecommunications infrastructure is modern and
fully digitized, with satellite-earth stations, fiber-optic cables,
and an extensive broadband network

domestic: liberalization of the telecommunications sector beginning
in the late 1990s has led to increased competition especially in the
mobile services segment of the market

international: country code - 354; the CANTAT-3 and FARICE-1
submarine cable systems provide connectivity to Canada, the Faroe
Islands, UK, Denmark, and Germany; a planned new section of the
