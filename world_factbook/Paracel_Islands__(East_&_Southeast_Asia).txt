Paracel Islands  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Paracel Islands




Background:


The Paracel Islands are surrounded by productive fishing grounds and
by potential oil and gas reserves. In 1932, French Indochina annexed
the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle Island;
maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has
occupied the Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a
South Vietnamese garrison occupying the western islands. China built
a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and
artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and
Vietnam.
