Palau  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Palau




Background:


After three decades as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific
under US administration, this westernmost cluster of the Caroline
Islands opted for independence in 1978 rather than join the
Federated States of Micronesia. A Compact of Free Association with
the US was approved in 1986 but not ratified until 1993. It entered
into force the following year when the islands gained independence.

Economy ::Palau




Economy - overview:


The economy consists primarily of tourism, subsistence agriculture,
and fishing. The government is the major employer of the work force
relying heavily on financial assistance from the US. The Compact of
Free Association with the US, entered into after the end of the UN
trusteeship on 1 October 1994, provided Palau with up to $700
million in US aid for the following 15 years in return for
furnishing military facilities. Business and tourist arrivals
numbered 85,000 in 2007. The population enjoys a per capita income
roughly 50% higher than that of the Philippines and much of
Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the key tourist sector have been
greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the
rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries, and the
willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development.
