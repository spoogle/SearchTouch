Mayotte  (Africa)

Introduction ::Mayotte




Background:


Mayotte was ceded to France along with the other islands of the
Comoros group in 1843. It was the only island in the archipelago
that voted in 1974 to retain its link with France and forego
independence. In March 2009, Mayotte voted overwhelmingly to become
France's 101st department - and fifth overseas department - a change
scheduled to become official in 2011.

Economy ::Mayotte




Economy - overview:


Economic activity is based primarily on the agricultural sector,
including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte is not self
sufficient and must import a large portion of its food requirements,
mainly from France. The economy and future development of the island
are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an important
supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle to the
development of tourism.
