Chile  (South America)

Introduction ::Chile




Background:


Prior to the coming of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern
Chile was under Inca rule while the indigenous Mapuche inhabited
central and southern Chile. Although Chile declared its independence
in 1810, decisive victory over the Spanish was not achieved until
1818. In the War of the Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and
Bolivia and won its present northern regions. It was not until the
1880s that the Mapuche Indians were completely subjugated. After a
series of elected governments, a three-year-old Marxist government
of Salvador ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by
Augusto PINOCHET, who ruled until a freely elected president was
installed in 1990. Sound economic policies, maintained consistently
since the 1980s, have contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty
rates by over half, and have helped secure the country's commitment
to democratic and representative government. Chile has increasingly
assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its
status as a stable, democratic nation.

Economy ::Chile




Economy - overview:


Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high level of
foreign trade and a reputation for strong financial institutions and
sound policy that have given it the strongest sovereign bond rating
in South America. Exports account for more than one-fourth of GDP,
with commodities making up some three-quarters of total exports.
Copper alone provides one-third of government revenue. During the
early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a role model for economic reform
was strengthened when the democratic government of Patricio AYLWIN -
which took over from the military in 1990 - deepened the economic
reform initiated by the military government. Growth in real GDP
averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell to half that level in 1998
because of tight monetary policies implemented to keep the current
account deficit in check and because of lower export earnings - the
latter a product of the global financial crisis. A severe drought
exacerbated the situation in 1999, reducing crop yields and causing
hydroelectric shortfalls and electricity rationing, and Chile
experienced negative economic growth for the first time in more than
15 years. In the years since then, growth has averaged 4% per year.
Chile deepened its longstanding commitment to trade liberalization
with the signing of a free trade agreement with the US, which took
effect on 1 January 2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or
regional trade agreements than any other country. It has 57 such
agreements (not all of them full free trade agreements), including
with the European Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and
Mexico. Over the past seven years, foreign direct investment inflows
have quadrupled to some $15 billion in 2010, but FDI had dropped to
about $7 billion in 2009 in the face of diminished investment
throughout the world. The Chilean government conducts a rule-based
countercyclical fiscal policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign
wealth funds during periods of high copper prices and economic
growth, and allowing deficit spending only during periods of low
copper prices and growth. As of September 2008, those sovereign
wealth funds - kept mostly outside the country and separate from
Central Bank reserves - amounted to more than $20 billion. Chile
used $4 billion from this fund to finance a fiscal stimulus package
to fend off recession. In December 2009, the OECD invited Chile to
become a full member, after a two year period of compliance with
organization mandates. The economy started to show signs of a
rebound in the fourth quarter, 2009, and GDP grew more than 5% in
2010. The magnitude 8.8 earthquake that struck Chile in February
2010 was one of the top ten strongest earthquakes on record. It
caused considerable damage near the epicenter, located about 70
miles from Concepcion - and about 200 miles southwest of Santiago.

Transnational Issues ::Chile




Disputes - international:


Chile and Peru rebuff Bolivia's reinvigorated claim to restore the
Atacama corridor, ceded to Chile in 1884, but Chile has offered
instead unrestricted but not sovereign maritime access through Chile
to Bolivian gas and other commodities; Chile rejects Peru's
unilateral legislation to change its latitudinal maritime boundary
with Chile to an equidistance line with a southwestern axis favoring
Peru, in October 2007, Peru took its maritime complaint with Chile
to the ICJ; territorial claim in Antarctica (Chilean Antarctic
Territory) partially overlaps Argentine and British claims; the
joint boundary commission, established by Chile and Argentina in
2001, has yet to map and demarcate the delimited boundary in the
inhospitable Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de Hielo Sur)



Illicit drugs:


transshipment country for cocaine destined for Europe and the
region; some money laundering activity, especially through the
Iquique Free Trade Zone; imported precursors passed on to Bolivia;
domestic cocaine consumption is rising, making Chile a significant
consumer of cocaine (2008)
