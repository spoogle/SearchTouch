Egypt  (Africa)

Introduction ::Egypt




Background:


The regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled
with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west,
allowed for the development of one of the world's great
civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series
of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last
native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were
replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who
introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who
ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the
Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the
conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Following the
completion of the Suez Canal in 1869, Egypt became an important
world transportation hub, but also fell heavily into debt.
Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of
Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman
Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in
1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty with the overthrow of the
British-backed monarchy in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High
Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have altered the
time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology
of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab
world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue
to overtax resources and stress society. The government has
struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's growing population through
economic reform and massive investment in communications and
physical infrastructure.

limited political activity by the Brotherhood and blocking its
influence (its members compete as independents in elections but do
not currently hold any seats in the legislature); civic society
groups are sanctioned, but constrained in practical terms; only
trade unions and professional associations affiliated with the
government are officially sanctioned; Internet social networking

three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and black; the
national emblem (a gold Eagle of Saladin facing the hoist side with
a shield superimposed on its chest above a scroll bearing the name
of the country in Arabic) centered in the white band; the band
colors derive from the Arab Liberation flag and represent oppression
(black), overcome through bloody struggle (red), to be replaced by a
bright future (white)

note: similar to the flag of Syria, which has two green stars in the
white band, Iraq, which has an Arabic inscription centered in the
white band, and Yemen, which has a plain white band

note: adopted 1979; after the signing of the 1979 peace with Israel,
Egypt sought to create an anthem less militaristic than its previous
one; Sayed DARWISH, commonly considered the father of modern
Egyptian music, composed the anthem







Economy ::Egypt




Economy - overview:


Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt is
bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic
activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralized during
the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but has opened up
considerably under former President Anwar EL-SADAT and current
President Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo from 2004 to 2008
aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment
and facilitate GDP growth. The global financial crisis has slowed
the reform efforts. The budget deficit climbed to over 8% of GDP and
Egypt's GDP growth slowed to 4.6% in 2009, predominately due to
reduced growth in export-oriented sectors, including manufacturing
and tourism, and Suez Canal revenues. In 2010, the government spent
more on infrastructure and public projects, and exports drove GDP
growth to more than 5%, but GDP growth in 2011 is unlikely to bounce
back to pre-global financial recession levels, when it stood at 7%.
Despite the relatively high levels of economic growth over the past
few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remain poor.
