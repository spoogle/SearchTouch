Italy  (Europe)

Introduction ::Italy




Background:


Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the
peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King
Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a
close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist
dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat
in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946
and economic revival followed. Italy was a charter member of NATO
and the European Economic Community (EEC). It has been at the
forefront of European economic and political unification, joining
the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999. Persistent problems include
illegal immigration, organized crime, corruption, high unemployment,
sluggish economic growth, and the low incomes and technical
standards of southern Italy compared with the prosperous north.

secondary peak of Mont Blanc)

earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, flooding; land subsidence in Venice

volcanism: Italy experiences significant volcanic activity; Etna
(elev. 3,330 m, 10,925 ft), which is in eruption as of 2010, is
Europe's most active volcano; flank eruptions pose a threat to
nearby Sicilian villages; Etna, along with the famous Vesuvius,
which remains a threat to the millions of nearby residents in the
Bay of Naples area, have both been deemed "Decade Volcanoes" by the
International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the
Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history and
close proximity to human populations; Stromboli, on its namesake
island, has also been continuously active with moderate volcanic
activity; other historically active volcanoes include Campi Flegrei,
Ischia, Larderello, Pantelleria, Vulcano, and Vulsini

Economy ::Italy




Economy - overview:


Italy has a diversified industrial economy, which is divided into a
developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, and a
less-developed, welfare-dependent, agricultural south, with high
unemployment. The Italian economy is driven in large part by the
manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and
medium-sized enterprises, many of them family owned. Italy also has
a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for
as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the
agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy has moved
slowly on implementing needed structural reforms, such as reducing
graft, overhauling costly entitlement programs, and increasing
employment opportunities for young workers, particularly women. The
international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy's labor
market, with unemployment rising from 6.2% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2010,
but in the longer-term Italy's low fertility rate and quota-driven
immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy. A rise in
exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery
nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1% in 2010 following a
5% contraction in 2009. The Italian government has struggled to
limit government spending, but Italy's exceedingly high public debt
remains above 115% of GDP, and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5% of GDP
in 2007 - exceeded 5% in 2009 and 2010, as the costs of servicing
the country's debt rose.
