Cameroon  (Africa)

Introduction ::Cameroon




Background:


The former French Cameroon and part of British Cameroon merged in
1961 to form the present country. Cameroon has generally enjoyed
stability, which has permitted the development of agriculture,
roads, and railways, as well as a petroleum industry. Despite slow
movement toward democratic reform, political power remains firmly in
the hands of President Paul BIYA.

Economy ::Cameroon




Economy - overview:


Because of its modest oil resources and favorable agricultural
conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity
economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as stagnate per
capita income, a relatively inequitable distribution of income, a
top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate for
business enterprise. Since 1990, the government has embarked on
various IMF and World Bank programs designed to spur business
investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade, and
recapitalize the nation's banks. The IMF is pressing for more
reforms, including increased budget transparency, privatization, and
poverty reduction programs. Weak prices for oil and cocoa led to the
significant slowdown in growth in 2009. The government is under
pressure to reduce its budget deficit, which by the government's own
forecast will hit 2.8% of GDP, but the presidential election in 2011
may make fiscal austerity difficult.

Telephone system:


general assessment: system includes cable, microwave radio relay,
and tropospheric scatter; Camtel, the monopoly provider of
fixed-line service, provides connections for only about 1 per 100
persons; equipment is old and outdated, and connections with many
parts of the country are unreliable

domestic: mobile-cellular usage, in part a reflection of the poor
condition and general inadequacy of the fixed-line network, has
increased sharply, reaching a subscribership base of 40 per 100
persons

international: country code - 237; landing point for the SAT-3/WASC
fiber-optic submarine cable that provides connectivity to Europe and
Asia; satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) (2009)



Broadcast media:


government maintains tight control over broadcast media; state-owned
Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV), broadcasting on both a television
and radio network, was the only officially recognized and fully
licensed broadcaster until August 2007 when the government finally
issued licenses to 2 private TV broadcasters and 1 private radio
broadcaster; about 70 privately-owned unlicensed radio stations
operating but are subject to closure at any time; foreign news
services required to partner with state-owned national station (2007)

control and patriation of residents in 2008; Cameroon and Nigeria
agree on maritime delimitation in March 2008; sovereignty dispute
between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an island at the mouth

Chad Commission's admonition to ratify the delimitation treaty,

refugees (country of origin): 20,000-30,000 (Chad); 3,000 (Nigeria);

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Cameroon is a source, transit, and destination
country for women and children trafficked for the purposes of forced
labor and commercial sexual exploitation; most victims are children
trafficked within country, with girls primarily trafficked for
domestic servitude and sexual exploitation; both boys and girls are
also trafficked within Cameroon for forced labor in sweatshops,
bars, restaurants, and on tea and cocoa plantations; children are
trafficked into Cameroon from neighboring states for forced labor in
agriculture, fishing, street vending, and spare-parts shops;
Cameroon is a transit country for children trafficked between Gabon
and Nigeria, and from Nigeria to Saudi Arabia; it is a source
country for women transported by sex-trafficking rings to Europe

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cameroon is on the Tier 2 Watch
List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat human trafficking in 2007, particularly in terms of efforts
to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders; while Cameroon
reported some arrests of traffickers, none of them were prosecuted
or punished; the government does not identify trafficking victims
among vulnerable populations nor does it monitor the number of
victims it intercepts (2008)
