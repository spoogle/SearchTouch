Luxembourg  (Europe)

Introduction ::Luxembourg




Background:


Founded in 963, Luxembourg became a grand duchy in 1815 and an
independent state under the Netherlands. It lost more than half of
its territory to Belgium in 1839 but gained a larger measure of
autonomy. Full independence was attained in 1867. Overrun by Germany
in both world wars, it ended its neutrality in 1948 when it entered
into the Benelux Customs Union and when it joined NATO the following
year. In 1957, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries
of the European Economic Community (later the European Union), and
in 1999 it joined the euro currency area.

Economy ::Luxembourg




Economy - overview:


This small, stable, high-income economy - benefiting from its
proximity to France, Belgium, and Germany - has historically
featured solid growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The
industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become
increasingly diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other
products. Growth in the financial sector, which now accounts for
about 28% of GDP, has more than compensated for the decline in
steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign
dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a tax
haven because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on
foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force.
Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic
crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below
the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007,
Luxembourg's economy contracted and 3.4% in 2009, but rebounded 2.6%
in 2010. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high
standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world, after
Liechtenstein and Qatar, and is the highest in the EU. Turmoil in
the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09
prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector
and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government
stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led
to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009, however, the deficit was
cut below 3% in 2010.
