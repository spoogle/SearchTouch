Field Listing :: Economy - overview

  This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the
  degree of market orientation, the level of economic development, the
  most important natural resources, and the unique areas of
  specialization. It also characterizes major economic events and
  policy changes in the most recent 12 months and may include a
  statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends.

  Economy - overview

Afghanistan
  Afghanistan's economy is recovering from decades of
  conflict. The economy has improved significantly since the fall of
  the Taliban regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of
  international assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector,
  and service sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few
  years, Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly
  dependent on foreign aid, agriculture, and trade with neighboring
  countries. Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages
  of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs.
  Criminality, insecurity, weak governance, and the Afghan
  Government's inability to extend rule of law to all parts of the
  country pose challenges to future economic growth. Afghanistan's
  living standards are among the lowest in the world. While the
  international community remains committed to Afghanistan's
  development, pledging over $67 billion at four donors' conferences
  since 2002, the Government of Afghanistan will need to overcome a
  number of challenges, including low revenue collection, anemic job
  creation, high levels of corruption, weak government capacity, and
  poor public infrastructure.

Akrotiri
  Economic activity is limited to providing services to the
  military and their families located in Akrotiri. All food and
  manufactured goods must be imported.

Albania
  Albania, a formerly closed, centrally-planned state, is
  making the difficult transition to a more modern open-market
  economy. Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6% between 2004-08,
  but declined to about 3% in 2009-10. Inflation is low and stable.
  The government has taken measures to curb violent crime, and
  recently adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large
  gray economy and attracting foreign investment. The economy is
  bolstered by annual remittances from abroad representing about 15%
  of GDP, mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this
  helps offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector,
  which accounts for over half of employment but only about one-fifth
  of GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and
  subsistence farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear
  property rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of
  land. Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower, and
  antiquated and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's
  poor business environment and lack of success in attracting new
  foreign investment needed to expand the country's export base. The
  completion of a new thermal power plant near Vlore has helped
  diversify generation capacity, and plans to upgrade transmission
  lines between Albania and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve
  the energy shortages. Also, with help from EU funds, the government
  is taking steps to improve the poor national road and rail network,
  a long-standing barrier to sustained economic growth.

Algeria
  Algeria's economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy
  of the country's socialist post-independence development model.
  Gradual liberalization since the mid-1990s has opened up more of the
  economy, but in recent years Algeria has imposed new restrictions on
  foreign involvement in its economy and largely halted the
  privatization of state-owned industries. Hydrocarbons have long been
  the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget
  revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has
  the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the
  fourth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Thanks
  to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $150
  billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon
  stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's external debt is
  extremely low at about 1% of GDP. Algeria has struggled to develop
  industires outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and
  an inert state bureaucracy.The government's efforts to diversify the
  economy by attracting foregin and domestic investment outside the
  energy sector have done little to reduce high poverty and youth
  unemployment rates. In 2010, Algeria began a five-year, $286 billion
  development program to update the country's infrastructure and
  provide jobs. The costly program will boost Algeria's economy in
  2011 but worsen the country's budget deficit. Long-term economic
  challenges include diversification from hydrocarbons, relaxing state
  control of the economy, and providing adequate jobs for youger
  Algerians.

American Samoa
  American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy
  in which more than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic
  activity is strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa
  conducts most of its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
  plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the
  primary export. The two tuna canneries account for 80% of
  employment. In late September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting
  tsunami devastated American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting
  transportation and power generation, and resulting in about 200
  deaths. The US Federal Emergency Management Agency is overseeing a
  relief program of nearly $25 million. Transfers from the US
  Government add substantially to American Samoa's economic well
  being. Attempts by the government to develop a larger and broader
  economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location, its limited
  transportation, and its devastating hurricanes. Tourism is a
  promising developing sector.

Andorra
  Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy,
  accounts for more than 80% of GDP. An estimated 11 million tourists
  visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status for some
  products and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
  advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain
  opened, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.
  The banking sector, with its partial "tax haven" status, also
  contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
  limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be
  imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
  Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and
  furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
  treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
  and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.

Angola
  Angola's high growth rate in recent years was driven by high
  international prices for its oil. Angola became a member of OPEC in
  late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9
  million barrels a day (bbl/day), somewhat less than the 2-2.5
  million bbl/day Angola's government had wanted. Oil production and
  its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond
  exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture
  provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the
  country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported
  growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar
  reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to
  high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much
  of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from
  the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar
  the countryside, even though peace was established after the death
  of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the
  government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China,
  Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's
  public infrastructure. The global recession temporarily stalled
  economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global
  recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009, and many construction
  projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to
  foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008
  and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November
  2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to
  rebuild international reserves. Although consumer inflation declined
  from 325% in 2000 to under 14% in 2010, Luanda has been unable to
  reduce inflation below 10%. The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in
  mid 2010, which, along with higher oil prices, should boost economic
  growth in all sectors. Corruption, especially in the extractive
  sectors, also is a major challenge.

Anguilla
  Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy depends
  heavily on luxury tourism, offshore banking, lobster fishing, and
  remittances from emigrants. Increased activity in the tourism
  industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector
  contributing to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put
  substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector,
  which is small but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the
  economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on
  revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on
  favorable weather conditions.

Antarctica
  Scientific undertakings rather than commercial pursuits
  are the predominate human activity in Antarctica. Fishing off the
  coast and tourism, both based abroad, account for Antarctica's
  limited economic activity. Antarctic fisheries, targeting three main
  species - Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus
  eleginoides and D. mawsoni), mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus
  gunnari), and krill (Euphausia superba) - reported landing 141,147
  metric tons in 2008-09 (1 July - 30 June). (Estimated fishing is
  from the area covered by the Convention on the Conservation of
  Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which extends slightly
  beyond the Antarctic Treaty area.) Unregulated fishing, particularly
  of Patagonian toothfish (also known as Chilean sea bass), is a
  serious problem. The CCAMLR determines the recommended catch limits
  for marine species. A total of 37,858 tourists visited the Antarctic
  Treaty area in the 2008-09 Antarctic summer, down from the 46,265
  visitors in 2007-2008 (estimates provided to the Antarctic Treaty by
  the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO);
  this does not include passengers on overflights). Nearly all of them
  were passengers on commercial (nongovernmental) ships and several
  yachts that make trips during the summer.

Antigua and Barbuda
  Tourism continues to dominate Antigua and
  Barbuda's economy, accounting for nearly 60% of GDP and 40% of
  investment. The dual-island nation's agricultural production is
  focused on the domestic market and constrained by a limited water
  supply and a labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages
  in tourism and construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type
  assembly for export with major products being bedding, handicrafts,
  and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the
  medium term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US,
  Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters.
  After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an
  ambitious fiscal reform program, and was successful in reducing its
  public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120% to about 90% in 2008. However,
  the global financial crisis that began in 2008, has led to a
  significant increase in the national debt, which topped 130% at the
  end of 2010. The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003
  to 2007, reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in
  hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup, but growth
  dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. In 2009, Antigua's
  economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis, suffering
  from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep
  decline in tourism. This decline continued in 2010 as the country
  struggled with a yawning budget deficit.

Arctic Ocean
  Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of
  natural resources, including petroleum, natural gas, fish, and seals.

Argentina
  Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly
  literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
  diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
  countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
  century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
  current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
  and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external
  indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious
  economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent
  history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default -
  the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in
  December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after
  taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to
  the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002.
  The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than
  in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real
  GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the
  subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled
  industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and
  reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions,
  and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also
  increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor
  KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as
  well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in early 2007,
  with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER
  succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid
  economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the
  following year as government policies held back exports and the
  world economy fell into recession. The economy has rebounded from
  the 2009 recession, but the government's continued reliance on
  expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already
  high inflation, which remains under-reported by official statistics.

Armenia
  After several years of double-digit economic growth, Armenia
  faced a severe economic recession with GDP declining more than 14%
  in 2009, despite large loans from multilateral institutions. Sharp
  declines in the construction sector and workers' remittances,
  particularly from Russia, were the main reasons for the downturn.
  The economy began to recover in 2010 with nearly 5% growth. Under
  the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia developed a modern
  industrial sector, supplying machine tools, textiles, and other
  manufactured goods to sister republics, in exchange for raw
  materials and energy. Armenia has since switched to small-scale
  agriculture and away from the large agroindustrial complexes of the
  Soviet era. Armenia has managed to reduce poverty, slash inflation,
  stabilize its currency, and privatize most small- and medium-sized
  enterprises. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, Armenia
  had made progress in implementing some economic reforms, including
  privatization, price reforms, and prudent fiscal policies, but
  geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies
  in important business sectors have made Armenia particularly
  vulnerable to the sharp deterioration in the global economy and the
  economic downturn in Russia. The conflict with Azerbaijan over the
  ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh contributed to
  a severe economic decline in the early 1990s and Armenia's borders
  with Turkey remain closed until 2010, when Turkey and Armenia signed
  an accord to reestablish diplomatic relations. Armenia is
  particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental
  support and most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or
  managed, especially in the energy sector. The electricity
  distribution system was privatized in 2002 and bought by Russia's
  RAO-UES in 2005. Construction of a pipeline to deliver natural gas
  from Iran to Armenia was completed in December 2008, and gas
  deliveries are slated to expand due to the April 2010 completion of
  the Yerevan Thermal Power Plant. Armenia has some mineral deposits
  (copper, gold, bauxite). Pig iron, unwrought copper, and other
  nonferrous metals are Armenia's highest valued exports. Armenia's
  severe trade imbalance has been offset somewhat by international
  aid, remittances from Armenians working abroad, and foreign direct
  investment. Armenia joined the WTO in January 2003. The government
  made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent
  years, but anti-corruption measures have been ineffective and the
  current economic downturn has led to a sharp drop in tax revenue and
  forced the government to accept large loan packages from Russia, the
  IMF, and other international financial institutions. Armenia will
  need to pursue additional economic reforms in order to regain
  economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment
  opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from two of
  its nearest neighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan.

Aruba
  Tourism is the mainstay of the small open Aruban economy,
  together with offshore banking. Oil refining and storage ended in
  2009. The rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade
  has resulted in a substantial expansion of other activities. Over
  1.5 million tourists per year visit Aruba with 75% of those from the
  US. Construction continues to boom with hotel capacity five times
  the 1985 level. Tourist arrivals rebounded strongly following a dip
  after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The government has made cutting
  the budget and trade deficits a high priority.

Ashmore and Cartier Islands
  no economic activity

Atlantic Ocean
  The Atlantic Ocean provides some of the world's most
  heavily trafficked sea routes, between and within the Eastern and
  Western Hemispheres. Other economic activity includes the
  exploitation of natural resources, e.g., fishing, dredging of
  aragonite sands (The Bahamas), and production of crude oil and
  natural gas (Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and North Sea).

Australia
  Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract
  high levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of
  coal, iron ore, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable
  energy sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40
  billion Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand
  the resources sector. Australia also has a large services sector and
  is a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food.
  Key tenets of Australia's trade policy include support for open
  trade and the successful culmination of the Doha Round of
  multilateral trade negotiations, particularly for agriculture and
  services. The Australian economy grew for 17 consecutive years
  before the global financial crisis. Subsequently, the Rudd
  government introduced a fiscal stimulus package worth over US$50
  billion to offset the effect of the slowing world economy, while the
  Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates to historic lows. These
  policies - and continued demand for commodities, especially from
  China - helped the Australian economy rebound after just one quarter
  of negative growth. The economy grew by 1.2% during 2009 - the best
  performance in the OECD. Unemployment, originally expected to reach
  8-10%, peaked at 5.7% in late 2009 and fell to 5.1% in 2010. As a
  result of an improved economy, the budget deficit is expected to
  peak below 4.2% of GDP and the government could return to budget
  surpluses as early as 2015. Australia was one of the first advanced
  economies to raise interest rates, with seven rate hikes between
  October 2009 and November 2010. The GILLARD government is focused on
  raising Australia's economic productivity to ensure the
  sustainability of growth, and continues to manage the symbiotic, but
  sometimes tense, economic relationship with China. Australia is
  engaged in the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and ongoing free
  trade agreement negotiations with China, Japan, and Korea.

Austria
  Austria, with its well-developed market economy and high
  standard of living, is closely tied to other EU economies,
  especially Germany's. Its economy features a large service sector, a
  sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed
  agricultural sector. Following several years of solid foreign demand
  for Austrian exports and record employment growth, the international
  financial crisis and global economic downturn in 2008 led to a
  recession that persisted until the third quarter of 2009. Austrian
  GDP contracted 3.8% in 2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in
  2010. Unemployment has not risen as steeply in Austria as elsewhere
  in Europe, partly because its government has subsidized reduced
  working hour schemes to allow companies to retain employees. Such
  stabilization measures, stimulus initiatives, and the government's
  income tax reforms pushed the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2009
  and about 5% in 2010, from only about 1.3% in 2008. The
  international financial crisis caused difficulties for some of
  Austria's largest banks whose extensive operations in central,
  eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large losses. The government
  provided bank support - including in some instances, nationalization
  - to prevent insolvency and possible regional contagion. In the
  medium-term all large Austrian banks will need additional capital.
  Even after the global economic outlook improves, Austria will need
  to continue restructuring, emphasizing knowledge-based sectors of
  the economy, and encouraging greater labor flexibility and greater
  labor participation to offset growing unemployment and Austria's
  aging population and exceedingly low fertility rate.

Azerbaijan
  Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 was
  attributable to large and growing oil exports, but some non-export
  sectors also featured double-digit growth, spurred by growth in the
  construction, banking, and real estate sectors. In 2009, economic
  growth remained above 9% even as oil prices moderated and growth in
  the construction sector cooled. In 2010, economic growth slowed to
  approximately 3.7%, although the impact of the global financial
  crisis was less severe than in many other countries in the region.
  The current global economic slowdown presents some challenges for
  the Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008
  highs, highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and
  lackluster attempts to diversify its economy. Azerbaijan's oil
  production increased dramatically in 1997, when Azerbaijan signed
  the first production-sharing arrangement (PSA) with the Azerbaijan
  International Operating Company. Oil exports through the
  Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while
  efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. However,
  Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting
  market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector
  corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on
  long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other
  obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for
  stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the
  continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
  Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining
  in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations
  of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the
  location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, and
  Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote
  sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur
  employment.

Bahamas, The
  The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean
  countries with an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore
  banking. Tourism together with tourism-driven construction and
  manufacturing accounts for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or
  indirectly employs half of the archipelago's labor force. Prior to
  2006, a steady growth in tourism receipts and a boom in construction
  of new hotels, resorts, and residences led to solid GDP growth but
  since then tourism receipts have begun to drop off. The global
  recession in 2009 took a sizeable toll on the Bahamas, resulting in
  a contraction in GDP and a widening budget deficit. The decline
  continued in 2010 as tourism from the US and sector investment
  lagged. Financial services constitute the second-most important
  sector of the Bahamian economy and, when combined with business
  services, account for about 36% of GDP. However, the financial
  sector currently is smaller than it has been in the past because of
  the enactment of new and more strict financial regulations in 2000
  that caused many international businesses to relocate elsewhere.
  Manufacturing and agriculture combined contribute approximately a
  tenth of GDP and show little growth, despite government incentives
  aimed at those sectors. Overall growth prospects in the short run
  rest heavily on the fortunes of the tourism sector.

Bahrain
  Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the
  Persian Gulf. Highly developed communication and transport
  facilities make Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with
  business in the Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain
  implemented a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006,
  the first FTA between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy,
  however, continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production
  and refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts,
  70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied
  industries). Other major economic activities are production of
  aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and
  construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center
  for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies
  as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum
  industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, is a long-term
  economic problem Bahrain struggles to address. In 2009, to help
  lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals, Bahrain reduced
  sponsorship for expatriate workers, increasing the costs of
  employing foreign labor. The global financial crisis caused funding
  for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic
  growth for Bahrain. Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow
  growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program,
  the financing of large government projects, and debt restructuring,
  such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air.

Bangladesh
  The economy has grown 5-6% per year since 1996 despite
  political instability, poor infrastructure, corruption, insufficient
  power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms.
  Bangladesh remains a poor, overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed
  nation. Although more than half of GDP is generated through the
  service sector, 45% of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture
  sector, with rice as the single-most-important product. Bangladesh's
  growth was resilient during the 2008-09 global financial crisis and
  recession. Garment exports, totaling $12.3 billion in FY09 and
  remittances from overseas Bangladeshis totaling $9.7 billion in FY09
  accounted for almost 25% of GDP.

Barbados
  Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on
  sugarcane cultivation and related activities. However, in recent
  years the economy has diversified into light industry and tourism
  with about three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed
  to services. Growth has rebounded since 2003, bolstered by increases
  in construction projects and tourism revenues, reflecting its
  success in the higher-end segment, but the sector faced declining
  revenues in 2009 with the global economic downturn. The country
  enjoys one of the highest per capita incomes in the region. Offshore
  finance and information services are important foreign exchange
  earners and thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US
  financial centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. The
  government continues its efforts to reduce unemployment, to
  encourage direct foreign investment, and to privatize remaining
  state-owned enterprises. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over
  100% in 2009, largely because a sharp slowdown in tourism and
  financial services led to a wide budget deficit.

Belarus
  Belarus has seen limited structural reform since 1995, when
  President LUKASHENKO launched the country on the path of "market
  socialism." In keeping with this policy, LUKASHENKO reimposed
  administrative controls over prices and currency exchange rates and
  expanded the state's right to intervene in the management of private
  enterprises. Since 2005, the government has re-nationalized a number
  of private companies. In addition, businesses have been subjected to
  pressure by central and local governments, including arbitrary
  changes in regulations, numerous rigorous inspections, retroactive
  application of new business regulations, and arrests of "disruptive"
  businessmen and factory owners. Continued state control over
  economic operations hampers market entry for businesses, both
  domestic and foreign. Government statistics indicate GDP growth was
  strong, surpassing 10% in 2008, despite the roadblocks of a tough,
  centrally directed economy with a high rate of inflation and a low
  rate of unemployment. However, the global crisis pushed the country
  into recession in 2009, and GDP grew only 0.2% for the year.
  Slumping foreign demand hit the industrial sector hard. Minsk has
  depended on a standby-agreement with the IMF to assist with balance
  of payments shortfalls. In line with IMF conditions, in 2009,
  Belarus devalued the ruble more than 40% and tightened some fiscal
  and monetary policies. On 1 January 2010, Russia, Kazakhstan and
  Belarus launched a customs union, with unified trade regulations and
  customs codes still under negotiation. In late January, Russia and
  Belarus amended their 2007 oil supply agreement. The new terms
  raised prices for above quota purchases, increasing Belarus' current
  account deficit. GDP grew 4.8% in 2010, in part, on the strength of
  renewed export growth. In December 2010, Belarus, Russia and
  Kazakhstan signed an agreement to form a Common Economic Space and
  Russia removed all Belarusian oil duties.

  This modern, private-enterprise economy has capitalized on
  its central geographic location, highly developed transport network,
  and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is
  concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north. With
  few natural resources, Belgium imports substantial quantities of raw
  materials and exports a large volume of manufactures, making its
  economy vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Roughly
  three-quarters of Belgium's trade is with other EU countries. In
  2009 Belgian GDP contracted by 2.7%, the unemployment rate rose
  slightly, and the budget deficit worsened because of large-scale
  bail-outs in the financial sector. Belgium's budget deficit widened
  to 4.8% of GDP in 2010, while public debt was just over 100% of GDP.
  Belgian banks have been severely affected by the international
  financial crisis with three major banks receiving capital injections
  from the government. An ageing population and rising social
  expenditures are also increasing pressure on public finances, making
  it likely the government will need to implement unpopular austerity
  measures to assuage investor concerns about Belgium's ability to
  restore fiscal balance.

Belize
  In this small, essentially private-enterprise economy,
  tourism is the number one foreign exchange earner followed by
  exports of marine products, citrus, cane sugar, bananas, and
  garments. The government's expansionary monetary and fiscal
  policies, initiated in September 1998, led to sturdy GDP growth
  averaging nearly 4% in 1999-2007, though growth slipped to 3.8% in
  2008, 0% in 2009, and 1.5% in 2010 as a result of the global
  slowdown, natural disasters, and the drop in the price of oil. Oil
  discoveries in 2006 bolstered economic growth. Exploration efforts
  continue and production increased a small amount in 2009. Major
  concerns continue to be the sizable trade deficit and heavy foreign
  debt burden. In February 2007, the government restructured nearly
  all of its public external commercial debt, which helped reduce
  interest payments and relieved some of the country's liquidity
  concerns. A key objective remains the reduction of poverty and
  inequality with the help of international donors.

Benin
  The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
  subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade.
  Growth in real output had averaged about 4% before the global
  recession, but fell to 2.5% in 2009 and 3% in 2010. Inflation has
  subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth,
  Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis
  on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing
  systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and
  communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business
  climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice
  system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307
  million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006.
  The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications,
  water, electricity, and agriculture. As result of these reforms,
  Benin has become the most competitive country in the West African
  Economic and Monetary Union, according to the World Economic Forum.
  The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt
  situation, with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced
  in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An
  insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's
  economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to
  increase domestic power production.

Bermuda
  Bermuda enjoys the third highest per capita income in the
  world, more than 50% higher than that of the US; the average cost of
  a house by the mid-2000s exceeded $1,000,000. Its economy is
  primarily based on providing financial services for international
  business and luxury facilities for tourists. A number of reinsurance
  companies relocated to the island following the 11 September 2001
  attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005
  contributing to the expansion of an already robust international
  business sector. Bermuda's tourism industry - which derives over 80%
  of its visitors from the US - continues to struggle but remains the
  island's number two industry. Most capital equipment and food must
  be imported. Bermuda's industrial sector is largely focused on
  construction and agriculture is limited, with only 20% of the land
  being arable.

Bhutan
  The economy, one of the world's smallest and least developed,
  is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main
  livelihood for more than 60% of the population. Agriculture consists
  largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged
  mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and
  other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely
  aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary links and
  dependence on India's financial assistance. The industrial sector is
  technologically backward, with most production of the cottage
  industry type. Most development projects, such as road construction,
  rely on Indian migrant labor. Model education, social, and
  environment programs are underway with support from multilateral
  development organizations. Each economic program takes into account
  the government's desire to protect the country's environment and
  cultural traditions. For example, the government, in its cautious
  expansion of the tourist sector, encourages visits by upscale,
  environmentally conscientious tourists. Complicated controls and
  uncertain policies in areas such as industrial licensing, trade,
  labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment. Hydropower
  exports to India have boosted Bhutan's overall growth. New
  hydropower projects will be the driving force behind Bhutan's
  ability to create employment and sustain growth in the coming years.

Bolivia
  Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries
  in Latin America. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the
  early 1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic
  growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was
  characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent
  protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export
  Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern
  hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial
  hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and
  required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts
  to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange
  for a predetermined service fee. After higher prices for mining and
  hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008, the global
  recession in 2009 slowed growth. A decline in commodity prices that
  began in late 2008, a lack of foreign investment in the mining and
  hydrocarbon sectors, a poor infrastructure, and the suspension of
  trade benefits with the United States will pose challenges for the
  Bolivian economy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina
  The interethnic warfare in Bosnia and
  Herzegovina caused production to plummet by 80% from 1992 to 1995
  and unemployment to soar. With an uneasy peace in place, output
  recovered in 1996-99 at high percentage rates from a low base; but
  output growth slowed in 2000-02. Part of the lag in output was made
  up in 2003-08 when GDP growth exceeded 5% per year. However, the
  country experienced negative GDP growth of almost 3% in 2009 due in
  large part to a reduction in exports caused by the global economic
  crisis. One of Bosnia's main economic challenges in 2010 has been to
  reduce spending on public sector wages and social benefits to meet
  the IMF's criteria for obtaining funding for budget shortfalls.
  Banking reform accelerated in 2001 as all the Communist-era payments
  bureaus were shut down; foreign banks, primarily from Austria and
  Italy, now control most of the banking sector. The konvertibilna
  marka (convertible mark or BAM)- the national currency introduced in
  1998 - is pegged to the euro, and confidence in the currency and the
  banking sector has increased. Bosnia's private sector is growing and
  foreign investment is slowly increasing, but government spending, at
  roughly 50% of GDP, remains high because of redundant government
  offices at the state, entity and municipal level. Privatization of
  state enterprises, however, has been slow, particularly in the
  Federation where political division between ethnically-based
  political parties makes agreement on economic policy more difficult.
  A sizeable current account deficit and high unemployment rate remain
  the two most serious macroeconomic problems. Successful
  implementation of a value-added tax in 2006 provided a predictable
  source of revenue for the government and helped rein in gray market
  activity. National-level statistics have also improved over time but
  a large share of economic activity remains unofficial and
  unrecorded. Bosnia and Herzegovina became a full member of the
  Central European Free Trade Agreement in September 2007.

Botswana
  Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest economic
  growth rates since independence in 1966, though growth fell below 5%
  in 2007-08, and turned sharply negative in 2009, with industry
  falling nearly 30%. Through fiscal discipline and sound management,
  Botswana transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the
  world to a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $13,100 in
  2010. Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit
  risk in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and
  currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export
  earnings, and about half of the government's revenues. Botswana's
  heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in
  the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services,
  subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors.
  Although unemployment was 7.5% in 2007 according to official
  reports, unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The prevalence
  of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens Botswana's
  impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond
  mining production within the next two decades overshadows long-term
  prospects.

Bouvet Island
  no economic activity; declared a nature reserve

Brazil
  Characterized by large and well-developed agricultural,
  mining, manufacturing, and service sectors, Brazil's economy
  outweighs that of all other South American countries, and Brazil is
  expanding its presence in world markets. Since 2003, Brazil has
  steadily improved its macroeconomic stability, building up foreign
  reserves, and reducing its debt profile by shifting its debt burden
  toward real denominated and domestically held instruments. In 2008,
  Brazil became a net external creditor and two ratings agencies
  awarded investment grade status to its debt. After record growth in
  2007 and 2008, the onset of the global financial crisis hit Brazil
  in September 2008. Brazil experienced two quarters of recession, as
  global demand for Brazil's commodity-based exports dwindled and
  external credit dried up. However, Brazil was one of the first
  emerging markets to begin a recovery. Consumer and investor
  confidence revived and GDP growth returned to positive in 2010,
  boosted by an export recovery. Brazil's strong growth and high
  interest rates make it an attractive destination for foreign
  investors. Large capital inflows over the past year have contributed
  to the rapid appreciation of its currency and led the government to
  raise taxes on some foreign investments. President Dilma ROUSSEFF
  has pledged to retain the previous administration's commitment to
  inflation targeting by the Central Bank, a floating exchange rate,
  and fiscal restraint.

British Indian Ocean Territory
  All economic activity is concentrated
  on the largest island of Diego Garcia, where a joint UK-US military
  facility is located. Construction projects and various services
  needed to support the military installation are performed by
  military and contract employees from the UK, Mauritius, the
  Philippines, and the US. There are no industrial or agricultural
  activities on the islands. The territory earns foreign exchange by
  selling fishing licenses and postage stamps.

British Virgin Islands
  The economy, one of the most stable and
  prosperous in the Caribbean, is highly dependent on tourism
  generating an estimated 45% of the national income. More than
  934,000 tourists, mainly from the US, visited the islands in 2008.
  In the mid-1980s, the government began offering offshore
  registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the islands, and
  incorporation fees now generate substantial revenues. Roughly
  400,000 companies were on the offshore registry by yearend 2000. The
  adoption of a comprehensive insurance law in late 1994, which
  provides a blanket of confidentiality with regulated statutory
  gateways for investigation of criminal offenses, made the British
  Virgin Islands even more attractive to international business.
  Livestock raising is the most important agricultural activity; poor
  soils limit the islands' ability to meet domestic food requirements.
  Because of traditionally close links with the US Virgin Islands, the
  British Virgin Islands has used the US dollar as its currency since
  1959.

Brunei
  Brunei has a small well-to-do economy that encompasses a
  mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship, government
  regulation, welfare measures, and village tradition. Crude oil and
  natural gas production account for just over half of GDP and more
  than 90% of exports. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia,
  and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income
  from domestic production. The government provides for all medical
  services and free education through the university level and
  subsidizes rice and housing. A new monetary authority was
  established in January 2011 with responsibilities that include
  monetary policy, monitoring of financial institutions, and currency
  trading activities. Other plans for the future include upgrading the
  labor force, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and
  tourist sectors, increasing agricultural production, and, in
  general, further widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.

Bulgaria
  Bulgaria, a former Communist country that entered the EU on
  1 January 2007, averaged more than 6% growth from 2004 to 2008,
  driven by significant amounts of foreign direct investment and
  consumption. Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment
  to economic reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global
  downturn sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows,
  and industrial production. GDP contracted by approximately 5% in
  2009, and stagnated in 2010, despite a significant recovery in
  exports. The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011, however.
  Corruption in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and the
  presence of organized crime remain significant challenges.

Burkina Faso
  Burkina Faso is a poor, landlocked country that relies
  heavily on cotton and gold exports for revenue. The country has few
  natural resources and a weak industrial base. About 90% of the
  population is engaged in subsistence agriculture, which is
  vulnerable to periodic drought. Cotton is the main cash crop. Since
  1998, Burkina Faso has embarked upon a gradual privatization of
  state-owned enterprises and in 2004 revised its investment code to
  attract foreign investment. As a result of this new code and other
  legislation favoring the mining sector, the country has seen an
  upswing in gold exploration and production. By 2010, gold had become
  the main source of export revenue.

Burma
  Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive
  government controls, inefficient economic policies, corruption, and
  rural poverty. Despite Burma's emergence as a natural gas exporter,
  socio-economic conditions have deteriorated under the regime's
  mismanagement, leaving most of the public in poverty, while military
  leaders and their business cronies exploit the country's ample
  natural resources. The economy suffers from serious macroeconomic
  imbalances - including rising inflation, fiscal deficits, multiple
  official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, a distorted
  interest rate regime, unreliable statistics, and an inability to
  reconcile national accounts to determine a realistic GDP figure.
  Burma's poor investment climate hampers the inflow of foreign
  investment; in recent years, foreign investors have shied away from
  nearly every sector except for natural gas, power generation,
  timber, and mining. The business climate is widely perceived as
  opaque, corrupt, and highly inefficient. Over 60% of the FY 2009-10
  budget is allocated to state owned enterprises - most operating at a
  deficit. The government has recently privatized a number of state
  owned enterprises, but most of the benefits have accrued to regime
  insiders and cronies. The most productive sectors will continue to
  be in extractive industries - especially oil and gas, mining, and
  timber - with the latter two causing significant environmental
  degradation. Other areas, such as manufacturing, tourism and
  services, struggle in the face of inadequate infrastructure,
  unpredictable trade policies, neglected health and education
  systems, and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003
  caused 20 private banks to close; private banks still operate under
  tight restrictions, limiting the private sector's access to credit.
  The United States, the European Union, Canada, and Australia have
  imposed financial and economic sanctions on Burma, prohibiting most
  financial transactions with Burmese entities, imposing travel bans
  on Burmese officials and others connected to the ruling regime, and
  banning imports of certain Burmese products. These sanctions
  affected the country's fledgling garment industry, isolated the
  struggling banking sector, and raised the costs of doing business
  with Burmese companies, particularly firms tied to Burmese regime
  leaders. The global crisis of 2008-09 caused exports and domestic
  consumer demand to drop. Remittances from overseas Burmese workers -
  who had provided significant financial support for their families -
  slowed or dried up as jobs were lost and migrant workers returned
  home. Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with
  its neighbors, better investment and business climates and an
  improved political situation are needed to promote serious foreign
  investment, exports, and tourism.

Burundi
  Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an
  underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
  agricultural which accounts for about 35% of GDP and employs more
  than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and
  tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though
  exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export
  earning - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on
  weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The
  Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the coffee trade.
  An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more
  than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania,
  and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two children go
  to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food,
  medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Burundi's GDP grew
  around 4% annually in 2006-09. Political stability and the end of
  the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has
  increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor
  education rates, a weak legal system, and low administrative
  capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. Burundi will
  continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and
  multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal
  cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government's revenues and its
  ability to pay salaries. Burundi joined the East African Community,
  which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and received $700
  million in debt relief in 2009. Instability spilling over from
  eastern Congo-Kinshasa and the ban on minerals smuggled across
  Burundi's border will be the main challenges to economic growth.

Cambodia
  From 2004 to 2007, the economy grew about 10% per year,
  driven largely by an expansion in the garment sector, construction,
  agriculture, and tourism. GDP contracted 1.5% in 2009 as a result of
  the global economic slowdown, but climbed more than 4% in 1010,
  driven by renewed exports. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO
  Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodian textile producers were
  forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as
  China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The garment industry
  currently employs more than 280,000 people - about 5% of the work
  force - and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports. In
  2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's
  territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for the
  government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is
  attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the
  northern parts of the country. The government has said opportunities
  exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In 2006, a
  US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
  (TIFA) was signed, and several rounds of discussions have been held
  since 2007. Rubber exports increased about 25% in 2009 due to rising
  global demand. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly,
  with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08,
  however, economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009. The
  global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports,
  and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The
  long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge.
  The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral
  donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's
  many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over
  the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which
  the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's
  demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than
  25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills,
  particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from
  an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.

Cameroon
  Because of its modest oil resources and favorable
  agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed
  primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces
  many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped countries,
  such as stagnate per capita income, a relatively inequitable
  distribution of income, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally
  unfavorable climate for business enterprise. Since 1990, the
  government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs
  designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in
  agriculture, improve trade, and recapitalize the nation's banks. The
  IMF is pressing for more reforms, including increased budget
  transparency, privatization, and poverty reduction programs. Weak
  prices for oil and cocoa led to the significant slowdown in growth
  in 2009. The government is under pressure to reduce its budget
  deficit, which by the government's own forecast will hit 2.8% of
  GDP, but the presidential election in 2011 may make fiscal austerity
  difficult.

Canada
  As an affluent, high-tech industrial society in the
  trillion-dollar class, Canada resembles the US in its
  market-oriented economic system, pattern of production, and affluent
  living standards. Since World War II, the impressive growth of the
  manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the
  nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily industrial
  and urban. The 1989 US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the
  1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes
  Mexico) touched off a dramatic increase in trade and economic
  integration with the US, its principal trading partner. Canada
  enjoys a substantial trade surplus with the US, which absorbs about
  three-fourths of Canadian exports each year. Canada is the US's
  largest foreign supplier of energy, including oil, gas, uranium, and
  electric power. Given its great natural resources, skilled labor
  force, and modern capital plant, Canada enjoyed solid economic
  growth from 1993 through 2007. Buffeted by the global economic
  crisis, the economy dropped into a sharp recession in the final
  months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its first fiscal deficit in 2009
  after 12 years of surplus. Canada's major banks, however, emerged
  from the financial crisis of 2008-09 among the strongest in the
  world, owing to the country's tradition of conservative lending
  practices and strong capitalization. During 2010, Canada's economy
  grew only 3%, because of weak exports.

Cape Verde
  This island economy suffers from a poor natural resource
  base, including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
  long-term drought and poor soil for agriculture on several of the
  islands. The economy is service oriented with commerce, transport,
  tourism, and public services accounting for about three-fourths of
  GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the
  share of food production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be
  imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not
  fully exploited. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit
  financed by foreign aid and remittances from its large pool of
  emigrants; remittances supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the
  lack of resources, sound economic management has produced steadily
  improving incomes. Continued economic reforms are aimed at
  developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to
  diversify the economy. Future prospects depend heavily on the
  maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances,
  and the momentum of the government's development program. Cape Verde
  became a member of the WTO in July 2008.

Cayman Islands
  With no direct taxation, the islands are a thriving
  offshore financial center. More than 93,000 companies were
  registered in the Cayman Islands as of 2008, including almost 300
  banks, 800 insurers, and 10,000 mutual funds. A stock exchange was
  opened in 1997. Tourism is also a mainstay, accounting for about 70%
  of GDP and 75% of foreign currency earnings. The tourist industry is
  aimed at the luxury market and caters mainly to visitors from North
  America. Total tourist arrivals exceeded 1.9 million in 2008, with
  about half from the US. About 90% of the islands' food and consumer
  goods must be imported. The Caymanians enjoy one of the highest
  outputs per capita and one of the highest standards of living in the
  world.

Central African Republic
  Subsistence agriculture, together with
  forestry, remains the backbone of the economy of the Central African
  Republic (CAR), with about 60% of the population living in outlying
  areas. The agricultural sector generates more than half of GDP.
  Timber has accounted for about 16% of export earnings and the
  diamond industry, for 40%. Important constraints to economic
  development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
  transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy
  of misdirected macroeconomic policies. Factional fighting between
  the government and its opponents remains a drag on economic
  revitalization. Distribution of income is extraordinarily unequal.
  Grants from France and the international community can only
  partially meet humanitarian needs.

Chad
  Chad's primarily agricultural economy will continue to be
  boosted by major foreign direct investment projects in the oil
  sector that began in 2000. At least 80% of Chad's population relies
  on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood.
  Chad's economy has long been handicapped by its landlocked position,
  high energy costs, and a history of instability. Chad relies on
  foreign assistance and foreign capital for most public and private
  sector investment projects. A consortium led by two US companies has
  been investing $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves - estimated at 1
  billion barrels - in southern Chad. Chinese companies are also
  expanding exploration efforts and are currently building a 300-km
  pipleline and the country's first refinery. The nation's total oil
  reserves are estimated at 1.5 billion barrels. Oil production came
  on stream in late 2003. Chad began to export oil in 2004. Cotton,
  cattle, and gum arabic provide the bulk of Chad's non-oil export
  earnings.

Chile
  Chile has a market-oriented economy characterized by a high
  level of foreign trade and a reputation for strong financial
  institutions and sound policy that have given it the strongest
  sovereign bond rating in South America. Exports account for more
  than one-fourth of GDP, with commodities making up some
  three-quarters of total exports. Copper alone provides one-third of
  government revenue. During the early 1990s, Chile's reputation as a
  role model for economic reform was strengthened when the democratic
  government of Patricio AYLWIN - which took over from the military in
  1990 - deepened the economic reform initiated by the military
  government. Growth in real GDP averaged 8% during 1991-97, but fell
  to half that level in 1998 because of tight monetary policies
  implemented to keep the current account deficit in check and because
  of lower export earnings - the latter a product of the global
  financial crisis. A severe drought exacerbated the situation in
  1999, reducing crop yields and causing hydroelectric shortfalls and
  electricity rationing, and Chile experienced negative economic
  growth for the first time in more than 15 years. In the years since
  then, growth has averaged 4% per year. Chile deepened its
  longstanding commitment to trade liberalization with the signing of
  a free trade agreement with the US, which took effect on 1 January
  2004. Chile claims to have more bilateral or regional trade
  agreements than any other country. It has 57 such agreements (not
  all of them full free trade agreements), including with the European
  Union, Mercosur, China, India, South Korea, and Mexico. Over the
  past seven years, foreign direct investment inflows have quadrupled
  to some $15 billion in 2010, but FDI had dropped to about $7 billion
  in 2009 in the face of diminished investment throughout the world.
  The Chilean government conducts a rule-based countercyclical fiscal
  policy, accumulating surpluses in sovereign wealth funds during
  periods of high copper prices and economic growth, and allowing
  deficit spending only during periods of low copper prices and
  growth. As of September 2008, those sovereign wealth funds - kept
  mostly outside the country and separate from Central Bank reserves -
  amounted to more than $20 billion. Chile used $4 billion from this
  fund to finance a fiscal stimulus package to fend off recession. In
  December 2009, the OECD invited Chile to become a full member, after
  a two year period of compliance with organization mandates. The
  economy started to show signs of a rebound in the fourth quarter,
  2009, and GDP grew more than 5% in 2010. The magnitude 8.8
  earthquake that struck Chile in February 2010 was one of the top ten
  strongest earthquakes on record. It caused considerable damage near
  the epicenter, located about 70 miles from Concepcion - and about
  200 miles southwest of Santiago.

China
  China's economy since the late 1970s has changed from a
  closed, centrally planned system to a more market-oriented one that
  plays a major role in the global economy - in 2010 China became the
  world's largest exporter. Reforms began with the phasing out of
  collectivized agriculture, and expanded to include the gradual
  liberalization of prices, fiscal decentralization, increased
  autonomy for state enterprises, creation of a diversified banking
  system, development of stock markets, rapid growth of the private
  sector, and opening to foreign trade and investment. China generally
  has implemented reforms in a gradualist fashion. In recent years,
  China has renewed its support for state-owned enterprises in sectors
  it considers important to "economic security," explicitly looking to
  foster globally competitive national champions. After keeping its
  currency tightly linked to the US dollar for years, in July 2005
  China revalued its currency by 2.1% against the US dollar and moved
  to an exchange rate system that references a basket of currencies.
  From mid 2005 to late 2008 cumulative appreciation of the renminbi
  against the US dollar was more than 20%, but the exchange rate
  remained virtually pegged to the dollar from the onset of the global
  financial crisis until June 2010, when Beijing allowed resumption of
  a gradual appreciation. The restructuring of the economy and
  resulting efficiency gains have contributed to a more than tenfold
  increase in GDP since 1978. Measured on a purchasing power parity
  (PPP) basis that adjusts for price differences, China in 2010 stood
  as the second-largest economy in the world after the US, having
  surpassed Japan in 2001. The dollar values of China's agricultural
  and industrial output each exceeded those of the US, although China
  was second to the US in the value of services it produced. Still,
  per capita income is below the world average. The Chinese government
  faces numerous economic development challenges, including: (a)
  reducing its high domestic savings rate and correspondingly low
  domestic demand; (b) sustaining adequate job growth for tens of
  millions of migrants and new entrants to the work force; (c)
  reducing corruption and other economic crimes; and (d) containing
  environmental damage and social strife related to the economy's
  rapid transformation. Economic development has progressed further in
  coastal provinces than in the interior, and approximately 200
  million rural laborers and their dependents have relocated to urban
  areas to find work. One demographic consequence of the "one child"
  policy is that China is now one of the most rapidly aging countries
  in the world. Deterioration in the environment - notably air
  pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the water table,
  especially in the north - is another long-term problem. China
  continues to lose arable land because of erosion and economic
  development. The Chinese government is seeking to add energy
  production capacity from sources other than coal and oil, focusing
  on nuclear and alternative energy development. In 2009, the global
  economic downturn reduced foreign demand for Chinese exports for the
  first time in many years, but China rebounded quickly, outperforming
  all other major economies in 2010 with GDP growth around 10%. The
  economy appears set to remain on a strong growth trajectory in 2011,
  lending credibility to the stimulus policies the regime rolled out
  during the global financial crisis. The government vows to continue
  reforming the economy and emphasizes the need to increase domestic
  consumption in order to make the economy less dependent on exports
  for GDP growth in the future, but China likely will make only
  marginal progress toward these rebalancing goals in 2011. Two
  economic problems China currently faces are inflation - which, late
  in 2010, surpassed the government's target of 3% - and local
  government debt, which swelled as a result of stimulus policies, and
  is largely off-the-books and potentially low-quality.

Christmas Island
  Phosphate mining had been the only significant
  economic activity, but in December 1987 the Australian government
  closed the mine. In 1991, the mine was reopened. With the support of
  the government, a $34 million casino opened in 1993, but closed in
  1998.

Clipperton Island
  Although 115 species of fish have been identified
  in the territorial waters of Clipperton Island, the only economic
  activity is tuna fishing.

Cocos (Keeling) Islands
  Coconuts, grown throughout the islands, are
  the sole cash crop. Small local gardens and fishing contribute to
  the food supply, but additional food and most other necessities must
  be imported from Australia. There is a small tourist industry.

Colombia
  Colombia experienced accelerating growth between 2002 and
  2007, chiefly due to improvements in domestic security, rising
  commodity prices, and to President URIBE's promarket economic
  policies. Foreign direct investment reached a record $10 billion in
  2008, and continues to flow in, especially in the oil sector. A
  series of policies enhanced Colombia's investment climate:
  pro-business reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led
  growth fueled mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug
  Eradication Act. Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking
  remain significant challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure
  requires major improvements to sustain economic expansion. Because
  of the global financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's
  exports, Colombia's economy grew only 2.7% in 2008, and 0.8% in 2009
  but rebounded to around 4.5% in 2010. The government has encouraged
  exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States
  and Venezuela, traditionally Colombia's largest trading partners;
  the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements
  with Asian and South American partners and awaits the approval of a
  Canadian trade accord by Canada's and EU's parliaments. The business
  sector remains concerned about Venezuela's trade restrictions on
  Colombian exports, an appreciating domestic currency, and the
  pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion
  Agreement.

Comoros
  One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of
  three islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and
  rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
  educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
  level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
  dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
  including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP,
  employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
  Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla,
  cloves, and ylang-ylang and Comoros' export earnings are easily
  disrupted by disasters such as fires. The country is not
  self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts
  for the bulk of imports. The government - which is hampered by
  internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive strategy to
  attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade education
  and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial
  enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote
  tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political
  problems have inhibited growth, which has averaged only about 1% in
  2006-09. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement
  GDP. In September 2009 the IMF approved Comoros for a three-year $21
  million loan. The IMF gave generally positive reports of the
  country's program performance as of October 2010. The African
  Development Bank approved a $34.6 million debt-relief package loan
  for Comoros in September 2010, and Comoros will attempt to qualifry
  for debt relief in 2012 under the IMF and World Bank's Heavily
  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.

Congo, Democratic Republic of the
  The economy of the Democratic
  Republic of the Congo - a nation endowed with vast potential wealth
  - is slowly recovering from decades of decline. Systemic corruption
  since independence in 1960 and conflict that began in May 1997 has
  dramatically reduced national output and government revenue,
  increased external debt, and resulted in the deaths of more than 5
  million people from violence, famine, and disease. Foreign
  businesses curtailed operations due to uncertainty about the outcome
  of the conflict, lack of infrastructure, and the difficult operating
  environment. Conditions began to improve in late 2002 with the
  withdrawal of a large portion of the invading foreign troops. The
  transitional government reopened relations with international
  financial institutions and international donors, and President
  KABILA began implementing reforms. Progress has been slow and the
  International Monetary Fund curtailed their program for the DRC at
  the end of March 2006 because of fiscal overruns. Much economic
  activity still occurs in the informal sector, and is not reflected
  in GDP data. Renewed activity in the mining sector, the source of
  most export income, boosted Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP
  growth from 2006-2008, however, the government's review of mining
  contracts that began in 2006, combined with a fall in world market
  prices for the DRC's key mineral exports temporarily weakened output
  in 2009, leading to a balance of payments crisis. The recovery in
  mineral prices beginning in mid 2009 boosted mineral exports, and
  emergency funds from the IMF boosted foreign reserves. An uncertain
  legal framework, corruption, a lack of transparency in government
  policy are long-term problems for the mining sector and the economy
  as a whole. The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less
  than half its 2008 level, but growth returned to 3% in 2010. The DRC
  signed a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF in 2009
  and received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief
  in 2010.

Congo, Republic of the
  The economy is a mixture of subsistence
  agriculture, an industrial sector based largely on oil and support
  services, and government spending. Oil has supplanted forestry as
  the mainstay of the economy, providing a major share of government
  revenues and exports. In the early 1980s, rapidly rising oil
  revenues enabled the government to finance large-scale development
  projects with GDP growth averaging 5% annually, one of the highest
  rates in Africa. Characterized by budget problems and overstaffing,
  the government has mortgaged a substantial portion of its oil
  earnings through oil-backed loans that have contributed to a growing
  debt burden and chronic revenue shortfalls. Economic reform efforts
  have been undertaken with the support of international
  organizations, notably the World Bank and the IMF. However, the
  reform program came to a halt in June 1997 when civil war erupted.
  Denis SASSOU-NGUESSO, who returned to power when the war ended in
  October 1997, publicly expressed interest in moving forward on
  economic reforms and privatization and in renewing cooperation with
  international financial institutions. Economic progress was badly
  hurt by slumping oil prices and the resumption of armed conflict in
  December 1998, which worsened the republic's budget deficit. The
  current administration presides over an uneasy internal peace and
  faces difficult economic challenges of stimulating recovery and
  reducing poverty. The drop in oil prices during the global crisis
  reduced oil revenue by about 30%, but the subsequent recovery of oil
  prices has boosted the economy's GDP and near-term prospects. In
  March 2006, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
  approved Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) treatment for Congo,
  receiving $1.9 billion in debt relief under the program in 2010.

Cook Islands
  Like many other South Pacific island nations, the Cook
  Islands' economic development is hindered by the isolation of the
  country from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets,
  lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural
  disasters, and inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture, employing
  more than one-quarter of the working population, provides the
  economic base with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit.
  Black pearls are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing
  activities are limited to fruit processing, clothing, and
  handicrafts. Trade deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants
  and by foreign aid overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and
  1990s, the country lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated
  public service and accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent
  reforms, including the sale of state assets, the strengthening of
  economic management, the encouragement of tourism, and a debt
  restructuring agreement, have rekindled investment and growth.

Coral Sea Islands
  no economic activity

Costa Rica
  Prior to the global economic crisis, Costa Rica enjoyed
  stable economic growth. The economy contracted 0.7% in 2009, but
  resumed growth at more than 3% in 2010. While the traditional
  agricultural exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still
  the backbone of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and
  specialized agricultural products have broadened export trade in
  recent years. High value added goods and services, including
  microchips, have further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to
  bring in foreign exchange, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity
  makes it a key destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain
  attracted by the country's political stability and relatively high
  education levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the
  free-trade zones; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest
  levels of foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America.
  However, many business impediments, such as high levels of
  bureaucracy, difficulty of enforcing contracts, and weak investor
  protection, remain. Poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20
  years, and the strong social safety net that had been put into place
  by the government has eroded due to increased financial constraints
  on government expenditures. Unlike the rest of Central America,
  Costa Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only
  represent about 2% of GDP. Immigration from Nicaragua has
  increasingly become a concern for the government. The estimated
  300,000-500,000 Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are
  an important source of - mostly unskilled - labor, but also place
  heavy demands on the social welfare system. The US-Central
  American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered
  into force on 1 January 2009, after significant delays within the
  Costa Rican legislature. CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased
  foreign direct investment in key sectors of the economy, including
  the insurance and telecommunications sectors recently opened to
  private investors. President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal
  reform in the coming year, seeking to boost revenue, possibly
  through revised tax legislation, to fund an increase in security
  services and education.

Cote d'Ivoire
  Cote d'Ivoire is heavily dependent on agriculture and
  related activities, which engage roughly 68% of the population. Cote
  d'Ivoire is the world's largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans
  and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil.
  Consequently, the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in
  international prices for these products, and, to a lesser extent, in
  climatic conditions. Cocoa, oil, and coffee are the country's top
  export revenue earners, but the country is also producing gold.
  Since the end of the civil war in 2003, political turmoil has
  continued to damage the economy, resulting in the loss of foreign
  investment and slow economic growth. GDP grew by more than 2% in
  2008 and around 4% per year in 2009-10. Per capita income has
  declined by 15% since 1999, but registered a slight improvement in
  2009-10. Power cuts caused by a turbine failure in early 2010 slowed
  economic activity. Cote d'Ivoire in 2010 signed agreements to
  restructure its Paris Club bilateral, other bilateral, and London
  Club debt. Cote d'Ivoire's long term challenges include political
  instability and degrading infrastructure.

Croatia
  Once one of the wealthiest of the Yugoslav republics,
  Croatia's economy suffered badly during the 1991-95 war as output
  collapsed and the country missed the early waves of investment in
  Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin
  Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes
  began to improve slowly, with moderate but steady GDP growth between
  4% and 6% led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer
  spending. Inflation over the same period has remained tame and the
  currency, the kuna, stable. Nevertheless, difficult problems still
  remain, including a stubbornly high unemployment rate, a growing
  trade deficit and uneven regional development. The state retains a
  large role in the economy, as privatization efforts often meet stiff
  public and political resistance. While macroeconomic stabilization
  has largely been achieved, structural reforms lag because of deep
  resistance on the part of the public and lack of strong support from
  politicians. The EU accession process should accelerate fiscal and
  structural reform. While long term growth prospects for the economy
  remain strong, Croatia will face significant pressure as a result of
  the global financial crisis. Croatia's high foreign debt, anemic
  export sector, strained state budget, and over-reliance on tourism
  revenue will result in higher risk to economic stability over the
  medium term.

Cuba
  The government continues to balance the need for economic
  loosening against a desire for firm political control. The
  government announced it would eliminate 500,000 state jobs by March
  2011 and has expanded opportunities for self-employment. President
  CASTRO said such changes were needed to update the economic model to
  ensure the survival of socialism. It has rolled back limited reforms
  undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise efficiency and
  alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services.
  The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than
  before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused by the loss of
  Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late 2000, Venezuela
  has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it currently
  supplies about 100,000 barrels per day of petroleum products. Cuba
  has been paying for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban
  personnel in Venezuela including some 30,000 medical professionals.

Curacao
  Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the
  mainstays of this small economy, which is closely tied to the
  outside world. Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade,
  the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed
  infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao
  has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil
  tankers. The Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery
  on the island from the government; most of the oil for the refinery
  is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are
  exported to the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are
  imported, with the US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major
  suppliers. The government is attempting to diversify its industry
  and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to
  expand business there. Poor soils and inadequate water supplies
  hamper the development of agriculture. Budgetary problems complicate
  reform of the health and pension systems for an aging population.

Cyprus
  The area of the Republic of Cyprus under government control
  has a market economy dominated by the service sector, which accounts
  for nearly four-fifths of GDP. Tourism, financial services, and real
  estate are the most important sectors. Erratic growth rates over the
  past decade reflect the economy's reliance on tourism, which often
  fluctuates with political instability in the region and economic
  conditions in Western Europe. Nevertheless, the economy in the area
  under government control has grown at a rate well above the EU
  average since 2000. Cyprus joined the European Exchange Rate
  Mechanism (ERM2) in May 2005 and adopted the euro as its national
  currency on 1 January 2008. An aggressive austerity program in the
  preceding years, aimed at paving the way for the euro, helped turn a
  soaring fiscal deficit (6.3% in 2003) into a surplus of 1.2% in
  2008, and reduced inflation to 4.7%. This prosperity came under
  pressure in 2009, as construction and tourism slowed in the face of
  reduced foreign demand triggered by the ongoing global financial
  crisis. Although Cyprus lagged its EU peers in showing signs of
  stress from the global crisis, the economy tipped into recession in
  mid 2009 and contracted 1.8% for the year. In addition, the budget
  deficit is on the rise and reached 5.7% of GDP in 2010, a violation
  of the EU's budget deficit criteria of no more than 3% of GDP. In
  response to the country's deteriorating finances, Nicosia is
  promising to implement measures to cut the cost of the state
  payroll, curb tax evasion, and revamp social benefits. However, it
  has been slow to act, lacking a consensus in parliament and among
  the social partners for its proposed measures.

Czech Republic
  The Czech Republic is one of the most stable and
  prosperous of the post-Communist states of Central and Eastern
  Europe. Maintaining an open investment climate has been a key
  element of the Czech Republic's transition from a communist,
  centrally planned economy to a functioning market economy. As a
  member of the European Union, with an advantageous location in the
  center of Europe, a relatively low cost structure, and a
  well-qualified labor force, the Czech Republic is an attractive
  destination for foreign investment. Prior to its EU accession in
  2004, the Czech government harmonized its laws and regulations with
  those of the European Union. The small, open, export-driven Czech
  economy grew by over 6% annually from 2005-2007 and by 2.5% in 2008.
  The conservative Czech financial system has remained relatively
  healthy throughout 2009. Nevertheless, the real economy contracted
  by 4.1% in 2009, mainly due to a significant drop in external demand
  as the Czech Republic's main export markets fell into recession. GDP
  is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2010, driven largely by a rebound in
  external demand, particularly from Gremany.

Denmark
  This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech
  agricultural sector, state-of-the-art industry with world-leading
  firms in pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping and renewable energy,
  and a high dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is also
  characterized by extensive government welfare measures, an equitable
  distribution of income, and comfortable living standards. Denmark is
  a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance
  of payments surplus. After a long consumption-driven upswing,
  Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing
  boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09. The global
  financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through
  increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer
  confidence, and investment. The global financial crises cut Danish
  GDP by 0.9% in 2008 and 4.7% in 2009. Historically low levels of
  unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5%,
  about half the level of the EU. Denmark made a modest recovery in
  2010 in part because of increased government spending. An impending
  decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major
  long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for
  many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit
  during 2009-10. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among
  the strongest in the EU. Despite previously meeting the criteria to
  join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark
  has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to
  the euro.

Dhekelia
  Economic activity is limited to providing services to the
  military and their families located in Dhekelia. All food and
  manufactured goods must be imported.

Djibouti
  The economy is based on service activities connected with
  the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
  the Horn of Africa. Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the
  capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty
  rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most
  food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit
  port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
  center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia
  represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal.
  Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
  is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help
  support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.
  An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a
  major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed
  tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high
  value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance
  of payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between
  1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population
  growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Djibouti has
  experienced relatively minimal impact from the global economic
  downturn, but its reliance on diesel-generated electricity and
  imported food leave average consumers vulnerable to global price
  shocks.

Dominica
  The Dominican economy has been dependent on agriculture -
  primarily bananas - in years past, but increasingly has been driven
  by tourism as the government seeks to promote Dominica as an
  "ecotourism" destination. In order to diversify the island's
  production base, the government also is attempting to develop an
  offshore financial sector and has signed an agreement with the EU to
  develop geothermal energy resources. In 2003, the government began a
  comprehensive restructuring of the economy - including elimination
  of price controls, privatization of the state banana company, and
  tax increases - to address an economic and financial crisis and to
  meet IMF requirements. This restructuring paved the way for an
  economic recovery - real growth for 2006 reached a two-decade high -
  and helped to reduce the debt burden, which remains at about 85% of
  GDP. Hurricane Dean struck the island in August 2007 causing damages
  equivalent to 20% of GDP. In 2009, growth slowed as a result of the
  global recession; it picked up only slightly in 2010.

Dominican Republic
  The Dominican Republic has long been viewed
  primarily as an exporter of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, but in
  recent years the service sector has overtaken agriculture as the
  economy's largest employer, due to growth in tourism and free trade
  zones. The economy is highly dependent upon the US, the destination
  for nearly 60% of exports. Remittances from the US amount to about a
  tenth of GDP, equivalent to almost half of exports and
  three-quarters of tourism receipts. The country suffers from marked
  income inequality; the poorest half of the population receives less
  than one-fifth of GDP, while the richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of
  GDP. High unemployment and underemployment remains an important
  long-term challenge. The Central America-Dominican Republic Free
  Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) came into force in March 2007, boosting
  investment and exports and reducing losses to the Asian garment
  industry. The growth of the Dominican Republic's economy slowed in
  2008-09 because of the global recession, but still remained one of
  the fastest growing in the region.

Ecuador
  Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum
  resources, which have accounted for more than half of the country's
  export earnings and one-fourth of public sector revenues in recent
  years. In 1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with
  GDP contracting by more than 6%. Poverty increased significantly,
  the banking system collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its external
  debt later that year. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series
  of structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US
  dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and
  positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high
  oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From
  2002-06 the economy grew 5.5%, the highest five-year average in 25
  years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth
  rate of 7.2% in 2008, in large part due to high global petroleum
  prices. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007,
  defaulted on Ecuador's sovereign debt in December 2008, refusing to
  make payment on $3.2 billion in international bonds, representing
  over 80% of Ecuador's private external debt. Economic policies under
  the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009
  terminating 13 bilateral investment treaties - have generated
  economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The
  Ecuadorian economy slowed to 0.4% growth in 2009 due to the global
  financial crisis, and the sharp decline in world oil prices and
  remittance flows, but picked up to a 2.4% growth rate in 2010.

Egypt
  Occupying the northeast corner of the African continent, Egypt
  is bisected by the highly fertile Nile valley, where most economic
  activity takes place. Egypt's economy was highly centralized during
  the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but has opened up
  considerably under former President Anwar EL-SADAT and current
  President Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Cairo from 2004 to 2008
  aggressively pursued economic reforms to attract foreign investment
  and facilitate GDP growth. The global financial crisis has slowed
  the reform efforts. The budget deficit climbed to over 8% of GDP and
  Egypt's GDP growth slowed to 4.6% in 2009, predominately due to
  reduced growth in export-oriented sectors, including manufacturing
  and tourism, and Suez Canal revenues. In 2010, the government spent
  more on infrastructure and public projects, and exports drove GDP
  growth to more than 5%, but GDP growth in 2011 is unlikely to bounce
  back to pre-global financial recession levels, when it stood at 7%.
  Despite the relatively high levels of economic growth over the past
  few years, living conditions for the average Egyptian remain poor.

El Salvador
  Despite being the smallest country geographically in
  Central America, El Salvador has the third largest economy in the
  region. The economy took a hit from the global recession and real
  GDP contracted by 3.5% in 2009. The economy began a slow recovery in
  2010 on the back of improved export and remittances figures.
  Remittances accounted for 16% of GDP in 2009, and about a third of
  all households receive these transfers. In 2006 El Salvador was the
  first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free
  Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of
  processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the
  apparel sector amid increased Asian competition and the expiration
  of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. El Salvador has promoted an
  open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of
  privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution,
  banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the
  Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million
  compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the
  country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the
  civil war, through investments in education, public services,
  enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the
  adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost
  control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response
  to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained
  by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any
  international financing.

Equatorial Guinea
  The discovery and exploitation of large oil
  reserves have contributed to dramatic economic growth but
  fluctuating oil prices have produced huge swings in GDP growth in
  recent years. Forestry, farming, and fishing are also major
  components of GDP. Subsistence farming is the dominate form of
  livelihood. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on
  cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the
  rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for
  agriculture-led growth (the government has stated its intention to
  reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture). A number of aid
  programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off
  since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. Government
  officials and their family members own most businesses, but
  corruption is rampant. Undeveloped natural resources include
  titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Growth
  remained strong in 2008, led by oil, but dropped in 2009-10, as the
  price of oil fell.

Eritrea
  Since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has faced
  the economic problems of a small, desperately poor country,
  accentuated by the recent implementation of restrictive economic
  policies. Eritrea has a command economy under the control of the
  sole political party, the People's Front for Democracy and Justice
  (PFDJ). Like the economies of many African nations, a large share of
  the population - nearly 80% - is engaged in subsistence agriculture,
  but they produce only a small share of total output. Since the
  conclusion of the Ethiopian-Eritrea war in 2000, the government has
  maintained a firm grip on the economy, expanding the use of the
  military and party-owned businesses to complete Eritrea's
  development agenda. The government strictly controls the use of
  foreign currency by limiting access and availability. Few private
  enterprises remain in Eritrea. Eritrea's economy depends heavily on
  taxes paid by members of the diaspora. Erratic rainfall and the
  delayed demobilization of agriculturalists from the military
  continue to interfere with agricultural production, and Eritrea's
  recent harvests have been unable to meet the food needs of the
  country. The Government continues to place its hope for additional
  revenue on the development of several international mining projects.
  Despite difficulties for international companies in working with the
  Eritrean Government, a Canadian mining company signed a contract
  with the government in 2007 and began mineral extraction in 2010.
  Eritrea's economic future depends upon its ability to master social
  problems such as illiteracy, unemployment, and low skills, and more
  importantly, on the government's willingness to support a true
  market economy.

Estonia
  Estonia, a 2004 European Union entrant, has a modern
  market-based economy and one of the higher per capita income levels
  in Central Europe and the Baltic region. Estonia's successive
  governments have pursued a free market, pro-business economic agenda
  and have wavered little in their commitment to pro-market reforms.
  The current government has pursued relatively sound fiscal policies
  that have resulted in balanced budgets and very low public debt. The
  economy benefits from strong electronics and telecommunications
  sectors and strong trade ties with Finland, Sweden, and Germany.
  Tallinn's priority has been to sustain high growth rates - on
  average 8% per year from 2003 to 2007. Estonia's economy slowed down
  markedly and fell sharply into recession in mid-2008, primarily as a
  result of an investment and consumption slump following the bursting
  of the real estate market bubble. GDP dropped nearly 15% in 2009,
  among the world's highest rates of contraction. A modest recovery
  began in 2010, but unemployment stands above 13%. Estonia adopted
  the euro in January 2011.

Ethiopia
  Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on
  agriculture, accounting for almost 45% of GDP, and 85% of total
  employment. The agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought
  and poor cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian
  economy with exports of some $350 million in 2006, but historically
  low prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement
  income. Under Ethiopia's constitution, the state owns all land and
  provides long-term leases to the tenants; the system continues to
  hamper growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable
  to use land as collateral for loans. In November 2001, Ethiopia
  qualified for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries
  (HIPC) initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's
  debt. The global economic downturn led to balance of payments
  pressures, partially alleviated by recent emergency funding from the
  IMF. While GDP growth has remained high, per capita inome is among
  the lowest in the world.

European Union
  Internally, the EU has abolished trade barriers,
  adopted a common currency, and is striving toward convergence of
  living standards. Internationally, the EU aims to bolster Europe's
  trade position and its political and economic power. Because of the
  great differences in per capita income among member states (from
  $7,000 to $78,000) and in national attitudes toward issues like
  inflation, debt, and foreign trade, the EU faces difficulties in
  devising and enforcing common policies. In the wake of the global
  economic crisis, the European Commission projected that the EU's
  economy would shrink by 4% in 2009 and 0.1% in 2010. The EU has
  recovered from the crisis faster than expected, however, and the
  Commission estimates 2010 growth at 1.8%. Significant risks to
  growth nevertheless remain, including, high official debts and
  deficits, aging populations, over-regulation of non-financial
  businesses, and doubts about the sustainability of European Economic
  and Monetary Union (EMU). In June 2010, prompted by the Greek
  financial crisis, the EU and the IMF set up a $1 trillion bailout
  fund to rescue any EMU member in danger of default, but it has not
  calmed market jitters that have diminished the value of the euro.
  Eleven established EU member states introduced the euro as their
  common currency on 1 January 1999 (Greece did so two years later),
  but the UK and Denmark have 'opt-outs' that allow them to keep their
  national currencies, and Sweden has not taken the steps needed to
  participate. Between 2004 and 2007, the EU admitted 12 countries
  that are, in general, less advanced economically than the other 15.
  Of the 12 most recent member states, only Slovenia (1 January 2007),
  Cyprus and Malta (1 January 2008), Slovakia (1 January 2009), and
  Estonia (1 January 2011) have adopted the euro; the remaining states
  other than the UK and Denmark are legally required to adopt the
  currency upon meeting EU's fiscal and monetary convergence criteria.

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
  The economy was formerly based on
  agriculture, mainly sheep farming, but today fishing contributes the
  bulk of economic activity. In 1987, the government began selling
  fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falkland
  Islands' exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more than
  $40 million per year, which help support the island's health,
  education, and welfare system. Squid accounts for 75% of the fish
  taken. Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish
  winter fodder. Foreign exchange earnings come from shipments of
  high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.
  The islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
  Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around
  the islands in 1993, and early seismic surveys suggest substantial
  reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day; to date, no
  exploitable site has been identified. An agreement between Argentina
  and the UK in 1995 seeks to defuse licensing and sovereignty
  conflicts that would dampen foreign interest in exploiting potential
  oil reserves. Political tensions between the UK and Argentina rose
  in early 2010 after a UK company began oil drilling activities in
  the waters around the Falkland Islands but abated somewhat when the
  drilling operation failed to discover commercially exploitable oil
  reserves. Tourism, especially eco-tourism, is increasing rapidly,
  with about 30,000 visitors in 2001. Another large source of income
  is interest paid on money the government has in the bank. The
  British military presence also provides a sizeable economic boost.

Faroe Islands
  The Faroese economy is dependent on fishing, which
  makes the economy vulnerable to price swings. The sector accounts
  for about 95% of exports and nearly half of GDP. In early 2008 the
  Faroese economy began to slow as a result of smaller catches and
  historically high oil prices that continue to trouble the economy.
  Though oil prices have come down, reduced catches, especially of cod
  and haddock, have continued to strain the Faroese economy. GDP grew
  0.5% in 2008-09. The slowdown in the Faroese economy followed a
  strong performance since the mid-1990s with annual growth rates
  averaging close to 6%, mostly a result of increased fish landings
  and salmon farming, and high export prices. Unemployment reached its
  lowest level in the first half of 2008, but increased to 3.9% in
  2009 and is rising. The Faroese Home Rule Government produced
  increasing budget surpluses that helped to reduce the large public
  debt, most of it to Denmark. However, total dependence on fishing
  and salmon farming make the Faroese economy very vulnerable to
  fluctuations in world demand. In addition, budget surpluses turned
  to deficits in 2008-09, and the economy at both the country and
  local level is running large deficits. Initial discoveries of oil in
  the Faroese area give hope for eventual oil production, which may
  provide a foundation for a more diversified economy and less
  dependence on Danish economic assistance. Aided by an annual subsidy
  from Denmark amounting to about 6% of Faroese GDP, the Faroese have
  a standard of living almost equal to that of Denmark and Greenland.

Fiji
  Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one
  of the most developed of the Pacific island economies though still
  with a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from
  Fijians working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with
  400,000 to 500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of
  foreign exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union
  markets but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar
  subsidies. Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial
  activity but is not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged
  by the December 2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time.
  In 2007 tourist arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job
  losses in the service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a
  difficult business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the
  interim government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term
  problems include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights,
  and the government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas
  remittances from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased
  significantly. Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in
  2006.

Finland
  Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market
  economy with per capita output roughly that of Austria, Belgium, the
  Netherlands, and Sweden. Trade is important with exports accounting
  for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly
  competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals,
  engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland
  excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber
  and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials,
  energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the
  climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
  self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export
  earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.
  Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU
  in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the
  worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit
  exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing
  one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of
  exports stimulated economic growth in 2010, and led to a lowering of
  unemployment. The recession left a deep mark on general government
  finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget
  surpluses into deficits. In the next few years, the great challenge
  of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit
  strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with
  general government adjustment measures. Longer-term, Finland must
  address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that
  threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.

France
  France is in the midst of transition from a well-to-do modern
  economy that has featured extensive government ownership and
  intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
  government has partially or fully privatized many large companies,
  banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as
  Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a
  strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public
  transport, and defense industries. With at least 75 million foreign
  tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world
  and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism.
  France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they
  maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social
  spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets
  on public health and welfare. France has weathered the global
  economic crisis better than most other big EU economies because of
  the relative resilience of domestic consumer spending, a large
  public sector, and less exposure to the downturn in global demand
  than in some other countries. Nonetheless, France's real GDP
  contracted 2.5% in 2009, but recovered somewhat in 2010, while the
  unemployment rate increased from 7.4% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2010. The
  government pursuit of aggressive stimulus and investment measures in
  response to the economic crisis, however, are contributing to a
  deterioration of France's public finances. The government budget
  deficit rose sharply from 3.4% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of GDP in
  2010, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to 84% over
  the same period. Paris is terminating stimulus measures, eliminating
  tax credits, and freezing most government spending to bring the
  budget deficit under the 3% euro-zone ceiling by 2013, and to
  highlight France's commitment to fiscal discipline at a time of
  intense financial market scrutiny of euro zone debt levels.
  President SARKOZY - who secured passage of pension reform in 2010 -
  is expected to seek passage of some tax reforms in 2011, but he may
  delay additional, more costly, reforms until after the 2012 election.

French Polynesia
  Since 1962, when France stationed military
  personnel in the region, French Polynesia has changed from a
  subsistence agricultural economy to one in which a high proportion
  of the work force is either employed by the military or supports the
  tourist industry. With the halt of French nuclear testing in 1996,
  the military contribution to the economy fell sharply. Tourism
  accounts for about one-fourth of GDP and is a primary source of hard
  currency earnings. Other sources of income are pearl farming and
  deep-sea commercial fishing. The small manufacturing sector
  primarily processes agricultural products. The territory benefits
  substantially from development agreements with France aimed
  principally at creating new businesses and strengthening social
  services.

French Southern and Antarctic Lands
  Economic activity is limited to
  servicing meteorological and geophysical research stations, military
  bases, and French and other fishing fleets. The fish catches landed
  on Iles Kerguelen by foreign ships are exported to France and
  Reunion.

Gabon
  Gabon enjoys a per capita income four times that of most
  sub-Saharan African nations, but because of high income inequality,
  a large proportion of the population remains poor. Gabon depended on
  timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in the early
  1970s. The oil sector now accounts for more than 50% of GDP although
  the industry is in decline as fields pass their peak production.
  Gabon continues to face fluctuating prices for its oil, timber, and
  manganese exports and the global recession led to a GDP contraction
  of 1.4% in 2009. Despite the abundance of natural wealth, poor
  fiscal management hobbles the economy. In 1997, an IMF mission to
  Gabon criticized the government for overspending on off-budget
  items, overborrowing from the central bank, and slipping on its
  schedule for privatization and administrative reform. The rebound of
  oil prices from 1999 to 2008 helped growth, but drops in production
  have hampered Gabon from fully realizing potential gains. Gabon
  signed a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2007, and
  later that year issued a $1 billion sovereign bond to buy back a
  sizable portion of its Paris Club debt.

Gambia, The
  The Gambia has sparse natural resource deposits and a
  limited agricultural base, and relies in part on remittances from
  workers overseas and tourist receipts. About three-quarters of the
  population depends on the agricultural sector for its livelihood.
  Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of
  peanuts, fish, and hides. The Gambia's natural beauty and proximity
  to Europe has made it one of the larger markets for tourism in West
  Africa, boosted by government and private sector investments in
  eco-tourism and upscale facilities. In the past few years, The
  Gambia's re-export trade - traditionally a major segment of economic
  activity - has declined, but its banking sector has grown rapidly.
  Unemployment and underemployment rates remain high; economic
  progress depends on sustained bilateral and multilateral aid, on
  responsible government economic management, and on continued
  technical assistance from multilateral and bilateral donors. The
  quality of fiscal management, however, is weak. The government has
  promised to raise civil service wages over the next two years and
  the deficit is projected to worsen.

Gaza Strip
  High population density, limited land and sea access,
  continuing isolation, and strict internal and external security
  controls have degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the
  smaller of the two areas in the Palestinian Territories.
  Israeli-imposed crossings closures, which became more restrictive
  after HAMAS violently took over the territory in June 2007, and
  fighting between HAMAS and Israel during December 2008-January 2009,
  resulted in the near collapse of most of the private sector,
  extremely high unemployment, and high poverty rates. Shortages of
  goods are met through large-scale humanitarian assistance - led by
  UNRWA - and the HAMAS-regulated black market tunnel trade that
  flourishes under the Gaza Strip's border with Egypt. However,
  chnages to the blockade in 2010 included moving from a white list -
  in which only approved items were allowed into Gaza through the
  crossings - to a black list, where all but non-approved items were
  allowed into Gaza through the crossings. Israeli authorities have
  recently signaled that exports from the territory might be possible
  in the future, but currently regular exports from Gaza are not
  permitted.

Georgia
  Georgia's economy sustained GDP growth of more than 10% in
  2006-07, based on strong inflows of foreign investment and robust
  government spending. However, GDP growth slowed in 2008 following
  the August 2008 conflict with Russia, and turned negative in 2009 as
  foreign direct investment and workers' remittances declined in the
  wake of the global financial crisis, but rebounded in 2010.
  Georgia's main economic activities include the cultivation of
  agricultural products such as grapes, citrus fruits, and hazelnuts;
  mining of manganese and copper; and output of a small industrial
  sector producing alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, metals,
  machinery, aircraft and chemicals. Areas of recent improvement
  include growth in the construction, banking services, and mining
  sectors, but reduced availability of external investment and the
  slowing regional economy are emerging risks. The country imports
  nearly all its needed supplies of natural gas and oil products. It
  has sizeable hydropower capacity, a growing component of its energy
  supplies. Georgia has overcome the chronic energy shortages and gas
  supply interruptions of the past by renovating hydropower plants and
  by increasingly relying on natural gas imports from Azerbaijan
  instead of from Russia. The construction on the Baku-T'bilisi-Ceyhan
  oil pipeline, the Baku-T'bilisi-Erzerum gas pipeline, and the
  Kars-Akhalkalaki Railroad are part of a strategy to capitalize on
  Georgia's strategic location between Europe and Asia and develop its
  role as a transit point for gas, oil and other goods. Georgia has
  historically suffered from a chronic failure to collect tax
  revenues; however, the government, since coming to power in 2004,
  has simplified the tax code, improved tax administration, increased
  tax enforcement, and cracked down on petty corruption. However, the
  economic downturn of 2008-09 eroded the tax base and led to a
  decline in the budget surplus and an increase in public borrowing
  needs. The country is pinning its hopes for renewed growth on a
  determined effort to continue to liberalize the economy by reducing
  regulation, taxes, and corruption in order to attract foreign
  investment, but the economy faces a more difficult investment
  climate both domestically and internationally.

Germany
  The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world
  in PPP terms and Europe's largest - is a leading exporter of
  machinery, vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment and benefits
  from a highly skilled labor force. Like its western European
  neighbors, Germany faces significant demographic challenges to
  sustained long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net
  immigration are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare
  system and necessitate structural reforms. The modernization and
  integration of the eastern German economy - where unemployment can
  exceed 20% in some municipalities - continues to be a costly
  long-term process, with annual transfers from west to east amounting
  in 2008 alone to roughly $12 billion. Reforms launched by the
  government of Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed
  necessary to address chronically high unemployment and low average
  growth, contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling
  unemployment, which in 2008 reached a new post-reunification low of
  7.8%. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced
  working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in
  unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World
  War II - and its healthy decrease in 2010. GDP contracted nearly 5%
  in 2009 but grew by 3.3% in 2010. Germany crept out of recession
  thanks largely to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports -
  primarily outside the Euro Zone - and relatively steady consumer
  demand. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and
  2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second
  term increased Germany's budget deficit to 3.3% in 2009 and to 3.6%
  in 2010. The EU has given Germany until 2013 to get its consolidated
  budget deficit below 3% of GDP. A new constitutional amendment
  likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no
  more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016.

Ghana
  Ghana is well endowed with natural resources and agriculture
  accounts for roughly one-third of GDP and employs more than half of
  the workforce, mainly small landholders. The services sector
  accounts for 50% of GDP. Gold and cocoa production and individual
  remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. Oil production at
  Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected
  to boost economic growth. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge
  Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in
  transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt
  relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in
  2002, and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief
  Initiative that took effect in 2006. In 2009 Ghana signed a
  three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to
  improve macroeconomic stability, private sector competitiveness,
  human resource development, and good governance and civic
  responsibility. Sound macro-economic management along with high
  prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008-10. In
  early 2010 President John Atta MILLS targeted recovery from high
  inflation and current account and budget deficits as his priorities.

Gibraltar
  Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive
  shipping trade, offshore banking, and its position as an
  international conference center. Tax rates are low to attract
  foreign investment. The British military presence has been sharply
  reduced and now contributes about 7% to the local economy, compared
  with 60% in 1984. The financial sector, tourism (almost 5 million
  visitors in 1998), gaming revenues, shipping services fees, and
  duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. The financial
  sector, tourism, and the shipping sector contribute 30%, 30%, and
  25%, respectively, of GDP. Telecommunications, e-commerce, and
  e-gaming account for the remaining 15%. In recent years, Gibraltar
  has seen major structural change from a public to a private sector
  economy, but changes in government spending still have a major
  impact on the level of employment.

Greece
  Greece has a capitalist economy with the public sector
  accounting for about 40% of GDP and with per capita GDP about
  two-thirds that of the leading euro-zone economies. Tourism provides
  15% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force,
  mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major
  beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP. The Greek
  economy grew by nearly 4.0% per year between 2003 and 2007, due
  partly to infrastructural spending related to the 2004 Athens
  Olympic Games, and in part to an increased availability of credit,
  which has sustained record levels of consumer spending. But the
  economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world
  financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure
  to address a growing budget deficit, which was triggered by falling
  state revenues, and increased government expenditures. The economy
  contracted by 2% in 2009, and 4.8% in 2010. Greece violated the EU's
  Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than
  3% of GDP from 2001 to 2006, but finally met that criterion in
  2007-08, before exceeding it again in 2009, with the deficit
  reaching 15.4% of GDP. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to
  9.4% of GDP in 2010. Public debt, inflation, and unemployment are
  above the euro-zone average while per capita income is below;
  unemployment rose to 12% in 2010. Eroding public finances, a
  credibility gap stemming from inaccurate and misreported statistics,
  and consistent underperformance on following through with reforms
  prompted major credit rating agencies in late 2009 to downgrade
  Greece's international debt rating, and has led the country into a
  financial crisis. Under intense pressure by the EU and international
  market participants, the government has adopted a medium-term
  austerity program that includes cutting government spending,
  reducing the size of the public sector, decreasing tax evasion,
  reforming the health care and pension systems, and improving
  competitiveness through structural reforms to the labor and product
  markets. Athens, however, faces long-term challenges to push through
  unpopular reforms in the face of often vocal opposition from the
  country's powerful labor unions and the general public. Greek labor
  unions are striking over new austerity measures, but the strikes so
  far have had a limited impact on the government's will to adopt
  reforms. An uptick in widespread unrest, however, could challenge
  the government's ability to implement reforms and meet budget
  targets, and could also lead to rioting or violence. In April 2010 a
  leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit
  rating; in May, the International Monetary Fund and Eurozone
  governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans
  worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to
  creditors. In exchange for the largest bailout ever assembled, the
  government announced combined spending cuts and tax increases
  totaling $40 billion over three years, on top of the tough austerity
  measures already taken. Greece, however, struggled to boost revenues
  and cut spending to meet 2010 targets set by the EU and the IMF,
  especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised
  upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. Greece's
  lenders are calling on Athens to step up efforts in 2011 to increase
  tax collection, shore up public enterprises, and rein in health
  spending, and are planning to give Greece more time to repay its
  EU-IMF loan. Greece responded by introducing major structural
  reforms, but investors still question whether Greece can sustain
  fiscal efforts in the face of a bleak economic outlook and public
  discontent.

Greenland
  The economy remains critically dependent on exports of
  shrimp and fish and on a substantial subsidy - about $650 million in
  2009 - from the Danish Government, which supplies nearly 60% of
  government revenues. The public sector, including publicly owned
  enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in
  Greenland's economy. Greenland's GDP contracted about 2% in 2009 as
  a result of the global economic slowdown. Budget surpluses turned to
  deficits beginning in 2007 and unemployment has risen. During the
  last decade the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued
  conservative fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has
  increased for better schools, health care and retirement systems.
  The Greenlandic economy has benefited from increasing catches and
  exports of shrimp, Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due
  to Greenland's continued dependence on exports of fish - which
  account for 82% of exports - the economy remains very sensitive to
  foreign developments. International consortia are increasingly
  active in exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's
  western coast, and international studies indicate the potential for
  oil and gas fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May
  2007 a US aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding
  with the Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter
  and a power generation facility, which takes advantage of
  Greenland's abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of
  mining, olivine sand continues to be produced and gold production
  has resumed in south Greenland. Tourism also offers another avenue
  of economic growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise
  lines now operating in Greenland's western and southern waters
  during the peak summer tourism season.

Grenada
  Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign
  exchange especially since the construction of an international
  airport in 1985. Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Emily (2005) severely
  damaged the agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa
  cultivation - which had been a key driver of economic growth.
  Grenada has rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes
  but is now saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process.
  Public debt-to-GDP is nearly 110%, leaving the THOMAS administration
  limited room to engage in public investments and social spending.
  Strong performances in construction and manufacturing, together with
  the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry, have
  also contributed to growth in national output; however, economic
  growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009,
  because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and
  remittances.

Guam
  The economy depends largely on US military spending and
  tourism. Total US grants, wage payments, and procurement outlays
  amounted to $1.3 billion in 2004. Over the past 30 years, the
  tourist industry has grown to become the largest income source
  following national defense. The Guam economy continues to experience
  expansion in both its tourism and military sectors.

Guatemala
  Guatemala is the most populous of the Central American
  countries with a GDP per capita roughly one-half that of the average
  for Latin America and the Caribbean. The agricultural sector
  accounts for nearly 15% of GDP and half of the labor force; key
  agricultural exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The 1996
  peace accords, which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major
  obstacle to foreign investment, and since then Guatemala has pursued
  important reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Central
  American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in July
  2006 spurring increased investment and diversification of exports,
  with the largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional
  agricultural exports. While CAFTA has helped improve the investment
  climate, concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers and
  poor infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment.
  The distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest
  decile comprising over 40% of Guatemala's overall consumption. More
  than half of the population is below the national poverty line and
  15% lives in extreme poverty. Poverty among indigenous groups, which
  make up 38% of the population, averages 76% and extreme poverty
  rises to 28%. 43% of children under five are chronically
  malnourished, one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world.
  President COLOM entered into office with the promise to increase
  education, healthcare, and rural development, and in April 2008 he
  inaugurated a conditional cash transfer program, modeled after
  programs in Brazil and Mexico, that provide financial incentives for
  poor families to keep their children in school and get regular
  health check-ups. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in
  the United States, it is the top remittance recipient in Central
  America, with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income
  equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports. Economic growth fell in
  2009 as export demand from US and other Central American markets
  fell and foreign investment slowed amid the global recession, but
  the economy recovered gradually in 2010 and will likely return to
  more normal growth rates by 2012. President COLOM, in his last year
  in office, will likely face opposition to economic reform,
  particularly over a long-delayed tax reform and an IMF-recommended
  reform to strengthen the banking sector. Larger budget deficits and
  increased debt can be expected in 2011.

Guernsey
  Financial services - banking, fund management, insurance -
  account for about 23% of employment and about 55% of total income in
  this tiny, prosperous Channel Island economy. Tourism,
  manufacturing, and horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers,
  have been declining. Financial services, construction, retail, and
  the public sector have been growing. Light tax and death duties make
  Guernsey a popular tax haven. The evolving economic integration of
  the EU nations is changing the environment under which Guernsey
  operates.

Guinea
  Guinea is a poor country that possesses major mineral,
  hydropower, and agricultural resources. The country has almost half
  of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounts for more
  than 70% of exports. Long-run improvements in the management of the
  economy, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country
  is to move out of poverty. Investor confidence has been sapped by
  rampant corruption, a lack of electricity and other infrastructure,
  a lack of skilled workers, and the political uncertainty resulting
  from the death of President Lansana CONTE in December 2008.
  International donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World
  Bank, cut their development programming significantly in response to
  the coup, and international partners have said that a resumption of
  aid will be contingent on a successful democratic transition with a
  democratically elected president and a functioning National
  Assembly. Growth rose slightly in 2006-08, primarily due to
  increases in global demand and commodity prices on world markets,
  but bauxite and alumina exports were negatively affected by the
  global economic downturn and the economy in 2009 contracted.
  International investors expressed renewed interest in Guinea's iron
  ore mines in 2010.

Guinea-Bissau
  One of the poorest countries in the world,
  Guinea-Bissau's legal economy depends mainly on farming and fishing,
  but trafficking narcotics is probably the most lucrative trade.
  Cashew crops have increased remarkably in recent years.
  Guinea-Bissau exports fish and seafood along with small amounts of
  peanuts, palm kernels, and timber. Rice is the major crop and staple
  food. However, intermittent fighting between Senegalese-backed
  government troops and a military junta destroyed much of the
  country's infrastructure and caused widespread damage to the economy
  in 1998; the civil war led to a 28% drop in GDP that year, with
  partial recovery in 1999-2002. In December 2003, the World Bank,
  IMF, and UNDP were forced to step in to provide emergency budgetary
  support in the amount of $107 million for 2004, representing over
  80% of the total national budget. The combination of limited
  economic prospects, a weak and faction-ridden government, and
  favorable geography have made this West African country a way
  station for drugs bound for Europe.

Guyana
  The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in
  recent years and is based largely on agriculture and extractive
  industries. The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six
  commodities - sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which
  represent nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible
  to adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices.
  Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME)
  in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily
  in the raw materials sector. Economic recovery since a 2005
  flood-related contraction was buoyed by increases in remittances and
  foreign direct investment in the sugar and rice industries as well
  as the mining sector. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled
  labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is juggling a
  sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public
  investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank,
  Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million
  debt, equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP, which along with other Highly
  Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the
  debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 120% in 2007. Guyana
  became heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led
  development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth slowed in
  2009-10 as a result of the world recession. The slowdown in the
  domestic economy and lower import costs helped to narrow the
  country's current account deficit, despite generally lower earnings
  from exports.

Haiti
  Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.1 magnitude
  earthquake damaged its capital city, Port-au-Prince, in January
  2010. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80%
  of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject
  poverty, the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country's GDP to
  contract an estimated 8% in 2010. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend
  on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming,
  and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters,
  exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic
  engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through
  Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has
  boosted apparel exports and investment by providing tariff-free
  access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation
  until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act (HELP); the apparel
  sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly
  one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign
  exchange, equaling nearly a quarter of GDP and more than twice the
  earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment
  because of insecurity and limited infrastructure, and a severe trade
  deficit. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving
  the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt
  forgiveness for over $1 billion of its debt through the
  Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative in 2009. The
  remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor
  countries in early 2010 but has since climbed back to about $500
  million. The government relies on formal international economic
  assistance for fiscal sustainability.

Heard Island and McDonald Islands
  The islands have no indigenous
  economic activity, but the Australian Government allows limited
  fishing in the surrounding waters.

Holy See (Vatican City)
  The Holy See is supported financially by a
  variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and
  donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions;
  these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic
  missions, and media outlets. The separate Vatican City State budget
  includes the Vatican museums and post office and is supported
  financially by the sale of stamps, coins, medals, and tourist
  mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications
  sales. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and
  direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence,
  which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief, and
  aid to churches in developing nations. The incomes and living
  standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who
  work in the city of Rome.

Honduras
  Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America,
  suffers from extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, as well
  as high underemployment. While historically dependent on the export
  of bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to
  include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. Nearly half of
  Honduras's economic activity is directly tied to the US, with
  exports to the US equivalent to 30% of GDP and remittances for
  another 20%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)
  came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foriegn direct
  investment, but physical and political insecurity may deter
  potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy
  registered marginally positive economic growth in 2010, insufficient
  to improve living standards for the nearly 60% of the population in
  poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal
  position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations
  and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His
  government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection
  and cutting expenditures. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF
  Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement
  has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in
  Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic
  mismanagement and the political coup.

Hong Kong
  Hong Kong has a free market economy highly dependent on
  international trade and finance - the value of goods and services
  trade, including the sizable share of re-exports, is about four
  times GDP. Hong Kong's open economy left it exposed to the global
  economic slowdown, but its increasing integration with China,
  through trade, tourism, and financial links, helped it recover more
  quickly than many observers anticipated. The Hong Kong government is
  promoting the Special Administrative Region (SAR) as the site for
  Chinese renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Hong Kong residents are
  allowed to establish RMB-denominated savings accounts;
  RMB-denominated corporate and Chinese government bonds have been
  issued in Hong Kong; and RMB trade settlement is allowed. The
  territory far exceeded the RMB conversion quota set by Beijing for
  trade settlements in 2010 due to the growth of earnings from exports
  to the mainland. RMB deposits grew to roughly 3.6% of total system
  deposits in Hong Kong by October 2010, an increase of over 250%
  since the beginning of the year. The government is pursuing efforts
  to introduce additional use of RMB in Hong Kong financial markets
  and is seeking to expand the RMB quota for 2011. The mainland has
  long been Hong Kong's largest trading partner, accounting for about
  half of Hong Kong's exports by value. Hong Kong's natural resources
  are limited, and food and raw materials must be imported. As a
  result of China's easing of travel restrictions, the number of
  mainland tourists to the territory has surged from 4.5 million in
  2001 to 17.7 million in 2009, outnumbering visitors from all other
  countries combined. Hong Kong has also established itself as the
  premier stock market for Chinese firms seeking to list abroad. In
  2009 mainland Chinese companies constituted about 40% of the firms
  listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and accounted for 60% of the
  Exchange's market capitalization. During the past decade, as Hong
  Kong's manufacturing industry moved to the mainland, its service
  industry has grown rapidly and in 2009 accounted for more than 90%
  of the territory's GDP. GDP growth averaged a strong 4% from 1989 to
  2008. Hong Kong's GDP fell in 2009 as a result of the global
  financial crisis, but a recovery began in third quarter 2009, and
  the economy grew nearly 6% in 2010. The Hong Kong government adopted
  several temporary fiscal policy support measures in response to the
  crisis that it may discontinue if strong growth is sustained. Credit
  expansion and tight housing supply conditions caused Hong Kong
  property prices to rise rapidly in 2010, and some lower income
  segments of the population are increasingly unable to afford
  adequate housing. Hong Kong continues to link its currency closely
  to the US dollar, maintaining an arrangement established in 1983.

Hungary
  Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to
  a market economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of
  the EU-25 average. The private sector accounts for more than 80% of
  GDP. Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are
  widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more
  than $70 billion. The government's austerity measures, imposed since
  late 2006, have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in
  2006 to 3.8% in 2010. Hungary's impending inability to service its
  short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late
  2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF-arranged financial assistance
  package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn,
  declining exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset
  accumulation, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in
  an economic contraction of 6.3% in 2009. The economy rebounded in
  2010 with a big boost from exports, and growth of more than 2.5% is
  expected in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at more than 11%.

Iceland
  Iceland's Scandinavian-type social-market economy combines a
  capitalist structure and free-market principles with an extensive
  welfare system. Prior to the 2008 crisis, Iceland had achieved high
  growth, low unemployment, and a remarkably even distribution of
  income. The economy depends heavily on the fishing industry, which
  provides 40% of export earnings, more than 12% of GDP, and employs
  7% of the work force. It remains sensitive to declining fish stocks
  as well as to fluctuations in world prices for its main exports:
  fish and fish products, aluminum, and ferrosilicon. Iceland's
  economy has been diversifying into manufacturing and service
  industries in the last decade, particularly within the fields of
  software production, biotechnology, and tourism. Abundant geothermal
  and hydropower sources have attracted substantial foreign investment
  in the aluminum sector and boosted economic growth, although the
  financial crisis has put several investment projects on hold. Much
  of Iceland's economic growth in recent years came as the result of a
  boom in domestic demand following the rapid expansion of the
  country's financial sector. Domestic banks expanded aggressively in
  foreign markets, and consumers and businesses borrowed heavily in
  foreign currencies, following the privatization of the banking
  sector in the early 2000s. Worsening global financial conditions
  throughout 2008 resulted in a sharp depreciation of the krona
  vis-a-vis other major currencies. The foreign exposure of Icelandic
  banks, whose loans and other assets totaled more than 10 times the
  country's GDP, became unsustainable. Iceland's three largest banks
  collapsed in late 2008. The country secured over $10 billion in
  loans from the IMF and other countries to stabilize its currency and
  financial sector, and to back government guarantees for foreign
  deposits in Icelandic banks. GDP fell 6.8% in 2009, and unemployment
  peaked at 9.4% in February 2009. GDP fell 3.4% in 2010. Since the
  collapse of Iceland's financial sector, government economic
  priorities have included: stabilizing the krona, reducing Iceland's
  high budget deficit, containing inflation, restructuring the
  financial sector, and diversifying the economy. Three new banks were
  established to take over the domestic assets of the collapsed banks.
  Two of them have foreign majority ownership, while the State holds a
  majority of the shares of the third. British and Dutch authorities
  have pressed claims totaling over $5 billion against Iceland to
  compensate their citizens for losses suffered on deposits held in
  the failed Icelandic bank, Landsbanki Islands. Iceland agreed to new
  terms with the UK and the Netherlands to compensate British and
  Dutch depositors, but the agreement must first be approved by the
  Icelandic President. Iceland began EU accession negotiations with
  the EU in July 2010, however, public support has dropped
  substantially because of concern about losing control over fishing
  resources and in reaction to measures taken by Brussels during the
  ongoing Eurozone crisis.

India
  India is developing into an open-market economy, yet traces of
  its past autarkic policies remain. Economic liberalization,
  including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned
  enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment,
  began in the early 1990s and has served to accelerate the country's
  growth, which has averaged more than 7% per year since 1997. India's
  diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, modern
  agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a
  multitude of services. Slightly more than half of the work force is
  in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic
  growth, accounting for more than half of India's output, with only
  one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large
  educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of
  information technology services and software workers. In 2010, the
  Indian economy rebounded robustly from the global financial crisis -
  in large part because of strong domestic demand - and growth
  exceeded 8% year-on-year in real terms. Merchandise exports, which
  account for about 15% of GDP, returned to pre-financial crisis
  levels. An industrial expansion and high food prices, resulting from
  the combined effects of the weak 2009 monsoon and inefficiencies in
  the government's food distribution system, fueled inflation which
  peaked at about 11% in the first half fo 2010, but has gradually
  decreased to single digits following a series of central bank
  interest rate hikes. New Delhi in 2010 reduced subsidies in fuel and
  fertilizers, sold a small percentage of its shares in some
  state-owned enterprises and auctioned off rights to radio bandwidth
  for 3G telecommunications in part to lower the government's deficit.
  The Indian Government seeks to reduce its deficit to 5.5% of GDP in
  FY 2010-11, down from 6.8% in the previous fiscal year. India's long
  term challenges include widespread poverty, inadequate physical and
  social infrastructure, limited non-agricultural employment
  opportunities, insufficient access to quality basic and higher
  education, and accommodiating rual-to-urban migration.

Indian Ocean
  The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting
  the Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas.
  It carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum
  products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its
  fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries
  for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia,
  Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
  for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped
  in the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western
  Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production
  comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and
  offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering
  countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
  and Thailand.

Indonesia
  Indonesia, a vast polyglot nation, has weathered the
  global financial crisis relatively smoothly because of its heavy
  reliance on domestic consumption as the driver of economic growth.
  Although the economy slowed significantly in 2009 from the 6%-plus
  growth rate recorded in 2007 and 2008, by 2010 growth returned to a
  6% rate. During the recession, Indonesia outperformed its regional
  neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting
  growth. The government made economic advances under the first
  administration of President YUDHOYONO, introducing significant
  reforms in the financial sector, including tax and customs reforms,
  the use of Treasury bills, and capital market development and
  supervision. Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in recent years has
  declined steadily because of increasingly robust GDP growth and
  sound fiscal stewardship. Indonesia still struggles with poverty and
  unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex
  regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among
  regions. YUDHOYONO's reelection, with respected economist BOEDIONO
  as his vice president, suggests broad continuity of economic policy,
  although the start of their term has been marred by corruption
  scandals and the departure of an internationally respected finance
  minister. The government in 2010 faces the ongoing challenge of
  improving Indonesia's insufficient infrastructure to remove
  impediments to economic growth, while addressing climate change
  mitigation and adaptation needs, particularly with regard to
  conserving Indonesia's forests and peatlands, the focus of a
  potentially trailblazing $1 billion REDD+ pilot project.

Iran
  Iran's economy is marked by an inefficient state sector,
  reliance on the oil sector, which provides the majority of
  government revenues, and statist policies, which create major
  distortions throughout the system. Private sector activity is
  typically limited to small-scale workshops, farming, and services.
  Price controls, subsidies, and other rigidities weigh down the
  economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth.
  Significant informal market activity flourishes. The legislature in
  late 2009 passed President Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD's bill to reduce
  subsidies, particularly on food and energy. The bill would phase out
  subsidies - which benefit Iran's upper and middle classes the most -
  over three to five years and replace them with cash payments to
  Iran's lower classes. However, the start of the program was delayed
  repeatedly throughout 2010 over fears of public reaction to higher
  prices. This is the most extensive economic reform since the
  government implemented gasoline rationing in 2007. The recovery of
  world oil prices in the last year increased Iran's oil export
  revenue by at least $10 billion over 2009, easing some of the
  financial impact of the newest round of international sanctions.
  Although inflation has fallen substantially since the mid-2000s,
  Iran continues to suffer from double-digit unemployment and
  underemployment. Underemployment among Iran's educated youth has
  convinced many to seek jobs overseas, resulting in a significant
  "brain drain."

Iraq
  An improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign
  investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in
  the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic
  improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the
  standard of living still depend on the government passing major
  policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil
  reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing
  interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in
  acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.
  Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over
  90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings.
  Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen
  before Operation Iraqi Freedom and government revenues have
  rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably
  will increase oil exports above the current level of 1.9 million
  barrels per day (bbl/day) as a result of new contracts with
  international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the 2.4
  million bbl/day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq is making
  modest progress in building the institutions needed to implement
  economic policy. In 2010, Bagdad signed a new agreement with both
  the IMF and World Bank for conditional aid programs that will help
  strengthen Iraq's economic institutions. Some reform-minded leaders
  within the Iraqi government are seeking to pass laws to strengthen
  the economy. This legislation includes a package of laws to
  establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a
  mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation,
  although these and other important reforms are still under
  contentious and sporadic negotiation. Iraq's recent contracts with
  major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil
  revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing,
  pipeling, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach
  their potential. The Government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to
  gain additional foreign investment in Iraq's economy. This includes
  an amendment to the National Investment Law, multiple international
  trade and investment events, as well as potential participation in
  joint ventures with state-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils
  also are using their own budgets to promote and facilitate
  investment at the local level. However, widespread corruption,
  inadequate infrastructure, insufficient essential services, and
  antiquated commercial laws and regulations stifle investment and
  continue to constrain the growth of private, non-energy sectors. The
  Central Bank has successfully held the exchange rate at
  approximately 1,170 Iraqi dinar/US dollar since January 2009.
  Inflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security
  situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed
  to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary
  Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.
  Reducing corruption and implementing reforms - such as bank
  restructuring and developing the private sector - would be important
  steps in this direction.

Ireland
  Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy. Ireland
  joined 11 other EU nations in circulating the euro on 1 January
  2002. GDP growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has
  dropped sharply since 2008 with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008,
  nearly 8% in 2009, and 1% in 2010, and further contraction is
  expectd in 2011. Ireland entered into a recession for the first time
  in more than a decade with the onset of the world financial crisis
  and subsequent severe slowdown in its domestic property and
  construction markets. Agriculture, once the most important sector,
  is now dwarfed by industry and services. Although the export sector,
  dominated by foreign multinationals, remains a key component of
  Ireland's economy, construction most recently fueled economic growth
  along with strong consumer spending and business investment.
  Property prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to
  2007 than in any other developed economy. However, average home
  prices have fallen 50% from the 2007 peak. In 2008 the COWEN
  government moved to guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the
  banking system, and establish partly-public venture capital funds in
  response to the country's economic downturn. In 2009, in an effort
  to stabilize the banking sector, the Irish Government established
  the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem
  commercial property and development loans from Irish banks. Faced
  with sharply reduced revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the
  Irish Government introduced the first in a series of draconian
  budgets in 2009. In addition to across-the-board cuts in spending,
  the 2009 budget included wage reductions for all public servants.
  These measures were not sufficient. The budget deficit reached
  nearly 38% of GDP in 2010 because of additional government support
  for the banking sector. In late 2010, the COWEN Government agreed to
  a $112 billion loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin
  recapitalize its banking sector and avoid defaulting on its
  sovereign debt, and initiated a four-year austerity plan to cut an
  additional $20 billion from its budget.

Isle of Man
  Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key
  sectors of the economy. The government offers low taxes and other
  incentives to high-technology companies and financial institutions
  to locate on the island; this has paid off in expanding employment
  opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
  and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in
  their contributions to GDP. The Isle of Man also attracts online
  gambling sites and the film industry. Trade is mostly with the UK.
  The Isle of Man enjoys free access to EU markets.

Israel
  Israel has a technologically advanced market economy. It
  depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
  equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
  developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20
  years. Cut diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
  products (fruits and vegetables) are the leading exports. Israel
  usually posts sizable trade deficits, which are covered by large
  transfer payments from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of
  the government's external debt is owed to the US, its major source
  of economic and military aid. Israel's GDP, after contracting
  slightly in 2001 and 2002 due to the Palestinian conflict and
  troubles in the high-technology sector, grew about 5% per year from
  2004-07. The global financial crisis of 2008-09 spurred a brief
  recession in Israel, but the country entered the crisis with solid
  fundamentals - following years of prudent fiscal policy and a series
  of liberalizing reforms - and a resilient banking sector, and the
  economy has shown signs of an early recovery. Following GDP growth
  of 4% in 2008, Israel's GDP slipped to 0.2% in 2009, but reached
  3.4% in 2010, as exports rebounded. The global economic downturn
  affected Israel's economy primarily through reduced demand for
  Israel's exports in the United States and EU, Israel's top trading
  partners. Exports account for about 25% of the country's GDP. The
  Israeli Government responded to the recession by implementing a
  modest fiscal stimulus package and an aggressive expansionary
  monetary policy - including cutting interest rates to record lows,
  purchasing government bonds, and intervening in the foreign currency
  market. The Bank of Israel began raising interest rates in the
  summer of 2009 when inflation rose above the upper end of the Bank's
  target and the economy began to show signs of recovery.

Italy
  Italy has a diversified industrial economy, which is divided
  into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies,
  and a less-developed, welfare-dependent, agricultural south, with
  high unemployment. The Italian economy is driven in large part by
  the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and
  medium-sized enterprises, many of them family owned. Italy also has
  a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for
  as much as 15% of GDP. These activities are most common within the
  agriculture, construction, and service sectors. Italy has moved
  slowly on implementing needed structural reforms, such as reducing
  graft, overhauling costly entitlement programs, and increasing
  employment opportunities for young workers, particularly women. The
  international financial crisis worsened conditions in Italy's labor
  market, with unemployment rising from 6.2% in 2007 to 8.4% in 2010,
  but in the longer-term Italy's low fertility rate and quota-driven
  immigration policies will increasingly strain its economy. A rise in
  exports and investment driven by the global economic recovery
  nevertheless helped the economy grow by about 1% in 2010 following a
  5% contraction in 2009. The Italian government has struggled to
  limit government spending, but Italy's exceedingly high public debt
  remains above 115% of GDP, and its fiscal deficit - just 1.5% of GDP
  in 2007 - exceeded 5% in 2009 and 2010, as the costs of servicing
  the country's debt rose.

Jamaica
  The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services, which
  now account for more than 60% of GDP. The country continues to
  derive most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and
  bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 15% of GDP and
  exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10%. Tourism revenues
  account for roughly 10% of GDP, and both arrivals and revenues grew
  in 2010, up 4% and 6% respectively. The Economic growth faces many
  challenges: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and
  underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%.
  Jamaica's onerous debt burden - the fourth highest per capita - is
  the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy,
  most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. The
  Government of Jamaica signed a $1.27 billion, 27-month Standby
  Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of
  payment support in February 2010. Other multilaterals have also
  provided millions of dollars in loans and grants. The government's
  difficult fiscal position hinders spending on infrastructure and
  social programs, particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking
  economy. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of
  having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt
  payments, while simultaneously attacking a serious and growing crime
  problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment
  exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is
  fueled by the drug trade.

Jan Mayen
  Jan Mayen is a volcanic island with no exploitable natural
  resources, although surrounding waters contain substantial fish
  stocks and potential untapped petroleum resources. Economic activity
  is limited to providing services for employees of Norway's radio and
  meteorological stations on the island.

Japan
  In the years following World War II, government-industry
  cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high technology, and a
  comparatively small defense allocation (1% of GDP) helped Japan
  develop a technologically advanced economy. Two notable
  characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking
  structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as
  keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial
  portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding
  under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic
  demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent
  on imported raw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is
  highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest
  in the world. Usually self sufficient in rice, Japan imports about
  60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains one of the
  world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
  global catch. For three decades, overall real economic growth had
  been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the
  1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the
  1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the after effects of
  inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s
  that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess
  debt, capital, and labor. The Japanese financial sector was not
  heavily exposed to sub-prime mortgages or their derivative
  instruments and weathered the initial effect of the recent global
  credit crunch, but a sharp downturn in business investment and
  global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan further
  into recession. Government stimulus spending helped the economy
  recover in late 2009 and 2010, but Tokyo is warning that GDP growth
  will slow in 2011. Prime Minister Kan's government has proposed
  opening the agricultural and services sectors to greater foreign
  competition and boosting exports through free-trade agreements, but
  debate continues on restructuring the economy and funding new
  stimulus programs in the face of a tight fiscal situation. Japan's
  huge government debt, which is approaching 200 percent of GDP,
  persistent deflation, and an aging and shrinking population are
  major complications for the economy.

Jersey
  Jersey's economy is based on international financial
  services, agriculture, and tourism. In 2005 the finance sector
  accounted for about 50% of the island's output. Potatoes,
  cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are important export
  crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is
  known worldwide and represents an important export income earner.
  Milk products go to the UK and other EU countries. Tourism accounts
  for one-quarter of GDP. In recent years, the government has
  encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey with the result that
  an electronics industry has developed, displacing more traditional
  industries. All raw material and energy requirements are imported as
  well as a large share of Jersey's food needs. Light taxes and death
  duties make the island a popular tax haven. Living standards come
  close to those of the UK.

Jordan
  Jordan's economy is among the smallest in the Middle East,
  with insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural
  resources, underlying the government's heavy reliance on foreign
  assistance. Other economic challenges for the government include
  chronic high rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large
  budget deficit. Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has
  implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade
  regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating most fuel
  subsidies, which in the past few years have spurred economic growth
  by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global
  economic slowdown, however, has depressed Jordan's GDP growth.
  Export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and the
  transport of re-exports have been hit the hardest. The Government
  approved two supplementary budgets in 2010, but sweeping tax cuts
  planned for 2010 did not materialize because of Amman's need for
  additional revenue to cover excess spending. The budget deficit is
  likely to remain high, at 5-6% of GDP, and Amman likely will
  continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance to finance the
  deficit in 2011. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively
  isolated from the international financial crisis because of its
  limited exposure to overseas capital markets. Jordan is currently
  exploring nuclear power generation to forestall energy shortfalls.

Kazakhstan
  Kazakhstan, geographically the largest of the former
  Soviet republics, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil fuel
  reserves and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals, such
  as uranium, copper, and zinc. It also has a large agricultural
  sector featuring livestock and grain. Kazakhstan's industrial sector
  is primarily focused on the extraction and processing of these
  natural resources. Kazakhstan enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01
  and 8% or more per year in 2002-07 - thanks largely to its booming
  energy sector but also to economic reform, good harvests, and
  increased foreign investment; GDP growth slowed dramatically
  following the near-collapse of the banking sector in late 2007 and
  the declines in oil and metals prices associated with the global
  economic downturn in 2008-09. Kazakhstan has embarked upon an
  industrial policy designed to diversify the economy away from
  overdependence on the oil sector as well expanding export markets
  away from its historical reliance on Russia. Nevertheless, growth is
  still driven by oil. The government has engaged in several disputes
  with Western oil companies over the terms of production agreements,
  most recently, with regard to the Kashagan project in 2007-08 and
  the Karachaganak project in 2009.

Kenya
  Although the regional hub for trade and finance in East
  Africa, Kenya has been hampered by corruption and by reliance upon
  several primary goods whose prices have remained low. In 1997, the
  IMF suspended Kenya's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Program due to
  the government's failure to maintain reforms and curb corruption.
  The IMF, which had resumed loans in 2000 to help Kenya through a
  drought, again halted lending in 2001 when the government failed to
  institute several anticorruption measures. In the key December 2002
  elections, Daniel Arap MOI's 24-year-old reign ended, and a new
  opposition government took on the formidable economic problems
  facing the nation. After some early progress in rooting out
  corruption and encouraging donor support, the KIBAKI government was
  rocked by high-level graft scandals in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, the
  World Bank and IMF delayed loans pending action by the government on
  corruption. The international financial institutions and donors have
  since resumed lending, despite little action on the government's
  part to deal with corruption. Post-election violence in early 2008,
  coupled with the effects of the global financial crisis on
  remittance and exports, reduced GDP growth to 1.7 in 2008, but the
  economy rebounded in 2009-10.

Kiribati
  A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has
  few natural resources and is one of the least developed Pacific
  Islands. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at
  the time of independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now
  represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
  fluctuated widely in recent years. Economic development is
  constrained by a shortage of skilled workers, weak infrastructure,
  and remoteness from international markets. Tourism provides more
  than one-fifth of GDP. Private sector initiatives and a financial
  sector are in the early stages of development. Foreign financial aid
  from the EU, UK, US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UN
  agencies, and Taiwan accounts for 20-25% of GDP. Remittances from
  seamen on merchant ships abroad account for more than $5 million
  each year. Kiribati receives around $15 million annually for the
  government budget from an Australian trust fund.

Korea, North
  North Korea, one of the world's most centrally directed
  and least open economies, faces chronic economic problems.
  Industrial capital stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of
  years of underinvestment and shortages of spare parts. Large-scale
  military spending draws off resources needed for investment and
  civilian consumption. Industrial and power output have declined in
  parallel from pre-1990 levels. Severe flooding in the summer of 2007
  aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic
  problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming
  practices, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel.
  Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the
  people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine
  threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from
  prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the
  government has allowed private "farmers' markets" to begin selling a
  wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an
  experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In
  October 2005, the government tried to reverse some of these policies
  by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a
  centralized food rationing system. By December 2005, the government
  terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in
  North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and
  restricted the activities of remaining international and
  non-governmental aid organizations. In mid-2008, North Korea began
  receiving food aid under a US program to deliver 500,000 metric tons
  of food via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental
  organizations; but Pyongyang stopped accepting the aid in March
  2009. In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of
  its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be
  exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week
  window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use
  yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease
  the restrictions by February 2010. Nevertheless, firm political
  control remains the Communist government's overriding concern, which
  likely will inhibit changes to North Korea's current economic system.

Korea, South
  Since the 1960s, South Korea has achieved an incredible
  record of growth and global integration to become a high-tech
  industrialized economy. Four decades ago, GDP per capita was
  comparable with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia.
  In 2004, South Korea joined the trillion dollar club of world
  economies, and currently is among the world's 20 largest economies.
  Initially, a system of close government and business ties, including
  directed credit and import restrictions, made this success possible.
  The government promoted the import of raw materials and technology
  at the expense of consumer goods, and encouraged savings and
  investment over consumption. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98
  exposed longstanding weaknesses in South Korea's development model
  including high debt/equity ratios and massive short-term foreign
  borrowing. GDP plunged by 6.9% in 1998, and then recovered by 9% in
  1999-2000. Korea adopted numerous economic reforms following the
  crisis, including greater openness to foreign investment and
  imports. Growth moderated to about 4-5% annually between 2003 and
  2007. With the global economic downturn in late 2008, South Korean
  GDP growth slowed to 0.2% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, the
  economy began to recover, in large part due to export growth, low
  interest rates, and an expansionary fiscal policy, and growth
  exceeded 6% in 2010. The South Korean economy's long term challenges
  include a rapidly aging population, inflexible labor market, and
  overdependence on manufacturing exports to drive economic growth.

Kosovo
  Over the past few years Kosovo's economy has shown
  significant progress in transitioning to a market-based system and
  maintaining macroeconomic stability, but it is still highly
  dependent on the international community and the diaspora for
  financial and technical assistance. Remittances from the diaspora -
  located mainly in Germany and Switzerland - are estimated to account
  for about 14% of GDP, and donor-financed activities and aid for
  another 7.5%. Kosovo's citizens are the poorest in Europe with an
  average annual per capita income of only $2,500. Unemployment,
  around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that
  encourages outward migration and black market activity. Most of
  Kosovo's population lives in rural towns outside of the capital,
  Pristina. Inefficient, near-subsistence farming is common - the
  result of small plots, limited mechanization, and lack of technical
  expertise. With international assistance, Kosovo has been able to
  privatize 50% of its state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by number, and
  over 90% of SOEs by value. Minerals and metals - including lignite,
  lead, zinc, nickel, chrome, aluminum, magnesium, and a wide variety
  of construction materials - once formed the backbone of industry,
  but output has declined because of ageing equipment and insufficient
  investment. A limited and unreliable electricity supply due to
  technical and financial problems is a major impediment to economic
  development. Kosovo's Ministry of Energy and Mining has solicited
  expressions of interest from private investors to develop a new
  power plant in order to address Kosovo and the region's unmet and
  growing demands for power. The official currency of Kosovo is the
  euro, but the Serbian dinar is also used in Serb enclaves. Kosovo's
  tie to the euro has helped keep core inflation low. Kosovo has one
  of the most open economies in the region, and continues to work with
  the international community on measures to improve the business
  environment and attract foreign investment. Kosovo has kept the
  government budget in balance as a result of efficient value added
  tax (VAT) collection at the borders and inefficient budget
  execution. In order to help integrate Kosovo into regional economic
  structures, UNMIK signed (on behalf of Kosovo) its accession to the
  Central Europe Free Trade Area (CEFTA) in 2006. However, Serbia and
  Bosnia have refused to recognize Kosovo's customs stamp or extend
  reduced tariff privileges for Kosovo products under CEFTA. In July
  2008, Kosovo received pledges of $1.9 billion from 37 countries in
  support of its reform priorities. In June 2009, Kosovo joined the
  World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and Kosovo began
  servicing its share of the former Yugoslavia's debt.

Kuwait
  Kuwait has a geographically small, but wealthy, relatively
  open economy with self-reported crude oil reserves of about 102
  billion barrels - about 9% of world reserves. Petroleum accounts for
  nearly half of GDP, 95% of export revenues, and 95% of government
  income. Kuwaiti officials have committed to increasing oil
  production to 4 million barrels per day by 2020. The rise in global
  oil prices throughout 2010 is reviving government consumption and
  economic growth as Kuwait experiences a 20% increase in government
  budget revenue. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in
  part, because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due
  to the poor business climate and the acrimonious relationship
  between the National Assembly and the executive branch, which has
  stymied most movement on economic reforms. Nonetheless, the
  government in May 2010 passed a privatization bill that allows the
  government to sell assets to private investors, and in January
  passed an economic development plan that pledges to spend up to $130
  billion in five years to diversify the economy away from oil,
  attract more investment, and boost private sector participation in
  the economy. Increasing government expenditures by so large an
  amount during the planned time frame may be difficult to accomplish.

Kyrgyzstan
  Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a dominant
  agricultural sector. Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main
  agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported
  in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium,
  natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold
  exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine. Following
  independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market
  reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform.
  Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
  country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of
  the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in
  production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
  December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and
  exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and
  international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive
  medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. Bishkek
  agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and, in 2006, became
  eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.
  The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial
  fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and
  expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in
  2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher
  gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.3% in 2009. The
  overthrow of President BAKIEV in April, 2010 and subsequent ethnic
  clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking
  trade and agricultural production, as well as political instability,
  caused GDP to contract about 3.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit
  widened to 12% of GDP, reflecting significant increases in
  crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged
  infrastructure and bank recapitalization. Progress in
  reconstruction, fighting corruption, restructuring domestic
  industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to
  future growth.

Laos
  The government of Laos, one of the few remaining one-party
  Communist states, began decentralizing control and encouraging
  private enterprise in 1986. The results, starting from an extremely
  low base, were striking - growth averaged 6% per year from 1988-2008
  except during the short-lived drop caused by the Asian financial
  crisis that began in 1997. Despite this high growth rate, Laos
  remains a country with an underdeveloped infrastructure,
  particularly in rural areas. It has a rudimentary, but improving,
  road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications.
  Electricity is available in urban areas and in many rural districts.
  Subsistence agriculture, dominated by rice cultivation in lowland
  areas, accounts for about 30% of GDP and provides 80% of total
  employment. The government in FY08/09 received $560 million from
  international donors. Economic growth has reduced official poverty
  rates from 46% in 1992 to 26% in 2009. The economy has benefited
  from high foreign investment in hydropower, mining, and
  construction. Laos gained Normal Trade Relations status with the US
  in 2004, and is taking steps required to join the World Trade
  Organization, such as reforming import licensing. Related trade
  policy reforms will improve the business environment. On the fiscal
  side, Laos launched an effort to ensure the collection of taxes in
  2009 as the global economic slowdown reduced revenues from mining
  projects. Simplified investment procedures and expanded bank credits
  for small farmers and small entrepreneurs will improve Lao's
  economic prospects. The government appears committed to raising the
  country's profile among investors. The World Bank has declared that
  Laos's goal of graduating from the UN Development Program's list of
  least-developed countries by 2020 is achievable. According Laotian
  officials, the 7th Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011-15 will
  outline efforts to achieve Millennium Development Goals.

Latvia
  Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per
  year during 2006-07 but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a
  result of an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt
  exposure amid the softening world economy. GDP plunged 18% in 2009 -
  the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's worst
  declines that year - and another 1.8% in 2010. The IMF, EU, and
  other donors provided assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement
  to defend the currency's peg to the euro and reduce the fiscal
  deficit to about 5% of GDP over time. DOMBROVSKIS' government
  enacted major speding cuts to reduce the fiscal deficit to 7.8% of
  GDP in 2010, and plans to cut the deficit further in 2011. The
  majority of companies, banks, and real estate have been privatized,
  although the state still holds sizable stakes in a few large
  enterprises. Latvia officially joined the World Trade Organization
  in February 1999. EU membership, a top foreign policy goal, came in
  May 2004.

Lebanon
  Lebanon has a free-market economy and a strong laissez-faire
  commercial tradition. The government does not restrict foreign
  investment; however, the investment climate suffers from red tape,
  corruption, arbitrary licensing decisions, high taxes, tariffs, and
  fees, archaic legislation, and weak intellectual property rights.
  The Lebanese economy is service-oriented; main growth sectors
  include banking and tourism. The 1975-90 civil war seriously damaged
  Lebanon's economic infrastructure, cut national output by half, and
  all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and
  banking hub. In the years since, Lebanon has rebuilt much of its
  war-torn physical and financial infrastructure by borrowing heavily
  - mostly from domestic banks. In an attempt to reduce the ballooning
  national debt, the Rafiq HARIRI government in 2000 began an
  austerity program, reining in government expenditures, increasing
  revenue collection, and passing legislation to privatize state
  enterprises, but economic and financial reform initiatives stalled
  and public debt continued to grow despite receipt of more than $2
  billion in bilateral assistance at the 2002 Paris II Donors
  Conference. The Israeli-Hizballah conflict in July-August 2006
  caused an estimated $3.6 billion in infrastructure damage, and
  prompted international donors to pledge nearly $1 billion in
  recovery and reconstruction assistance. Donors met again in January
  2007 at the Paris III Donor Conference and pledged more than $7.5
  billion to Lebanon for development projects and budget support,
  conditioned on progress on Beirut's fiscal reform and privatization
  program. An 18-month political stalemate and sporadic sectarian and
  political violence hampered economic activity, particularly tourism,
  retail sales, and investment, until the new government was formed in
  July 2008. Political stability following the Doha Accord of May 2008
  helped boost tourism and, together with a strong banking sector,
  enabled real GDP growth of 7% per year in 2009-10 despite a slowdown
  in the region.

Lesotho
  Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho relies on
  remittances from miners employed in South Africa, customs duties
  from the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and export revenue
  for the majority of government revenue. However, the government has
  recently strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs
  duties. Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998
  permitted the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties
  for Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power
  needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the
  past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based
  on farm products that support the milling, canning, leather, and
  jute industries, as well as an apparel-assembly sector. Despite
  Lesotho's market-based economy being heavily tied to its neighbor
  South Africa, the US is an important trade partner because of the
  export sector's heavy dependence on apparel exports. Exports have
  grown significantly because of the trade benefits contained in the
  Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily
  based on subsistence agriculture, especially livestock, although
  drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality
  in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has
  signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the
  IMF. In July 2007, Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account
  Compact with the US worth $362.5 million. Economic growth dropped in
  2009, due mainly to the effects of the global economic crisis as
  demand for the country's exports declined and SACU revenue fell
  precipitously when South Africa - the primary contributor to the
  SACU revenue pool - went into recession, but growth returned to 3.5%
  in 2010.

Liberia
  Liberia is a low income country heavily reliant on foreign
  assistance for revenue. Civil war and government mismanagement
  destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure
  in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the
  country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the
  conclusion of fighting and the installation of a
  democratically-elected government in 2006, several have returned.
  Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct
  foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water,
  mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture,
  Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products,
  primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local
  manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
  President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and
  administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support
  from international donors, and encourage private investment.
  Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new
  sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first
  major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its
  Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010
  and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently
  eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to estabilish a
  sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club
  creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. Rebuilding
  infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial
  and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment
  in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation.

Libya
  The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the
  oil sector, which contribute about 95% of export earnings, 25% of
  GDP, and 80% of government revenue. The weakness in world
  hydrocarbon prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government tax income and
  constrained economic growth. Substantial revenues from the energy
  sector coupled with a small population give Libya one of the highest
  per capita GDPs in Africa, but little of this income flows down to
  the lower orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years
  have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader campaign
  to reintegrate the country into the international fold. This effort
  picked up steam after UN sanctions were lifted in September 2003 and
  as Libya announced in December 2003 that it would abandon programs
  to build weapons of mass destruction. The process of lifting US
  unilateral sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were
  removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign direct
  investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan oil and gas
  licensing rounds continue to draw high international interest; the
  National Oil Corporation (NOC) set a goal of nearly doubling oil
  production to 3 million bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC
  announced that that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces
  a long road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy,
  but initial steps - including applying for WTO membership, reducing
  some subsidies, and announcing plans for privatization - are laying
  the groundwork for a transition to a more market-based economy. The
  non-oil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for
  more than 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
  agricultural products to include the production of petrochemicals,
  iron, steel, and aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils
  severely limit agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of
  its food. Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the
  Great Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being
  invested in desalinization research to meet growing water demands.

Liechtenstein
  Despite its small size and limited natural resources,
  Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly
  industrialized, free-enterprise economy with a vital financial
  service sector and the highest per capita income in the world. The
  Liechtenstein economy is widely diversified with a large number of
  small businesses. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% -
  and easy incorporation rules have induced many holding companies to
  establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein providing 30% of state
  revenues. The country participates in a customs union with
  Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. It
  imports more than 90% of its energy requirements. Liechtenstein has
  been a member of the European Economic Area (an organization serving
  as a bridge between the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and
  the EU) since May 1995. The government is working to harmonize its
  economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008,
  Liechtenstein came under renewed international pressure -
  particularly from Germany - to improve transparency in its banking
  and tax systems. In December 2008, Liechtenstein signed a Tax
  Information Exchange Agreement with the US. Upon Liechtenstein's
  conclusion of 12 bilateral information-sharing agreements, the OECD
  in October 2009 removed the principality from its "grey list" of
  countries that had yet to implement the organization's Model Tax
  Convention.

Lithuania
  Lithuania gained membership in the World Trade
  Organization and joined the EU in May 2004. Despite Lithuania's EU
  accession, Lithuania's trade with its Central and Eastern European
  neighbors, and Russia in particular, accounts for a growing
  percentage of total trade. Privatization of the large, state-owned
  utilities is nearly complete. Foreign government and business
  support have helped in the transition from the old command economy
  to a market economy. Lithuania's economy grew on average 8% per year
  for the four years prior to 2008 driven by exports and domestic
  demand. However, GDP plunged nearly 15% in 2009 - during the 2008-09
  crisis the three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's
  worst economic declines. In 2009, the government launched a
  high-profile campaign, led by Prime Minister KUBILIUS, to attract
  foreign investment and to develop export markets. The current
  account deficit, which had risen to roughly 15% of GDP in 2007-08,
  recovered to a surplus of 4% 2009 and 3.5% in 2010 in the wake of a
  cutback in imports to almost half the 2008 level. Nevertheless,
  economic growth was flat and unemployment continued upward to 16% in
  2010.

Luxembourg
  This small, stable, high-income economy - benefiting from
  its proximity to France, Belgium, and Germany - has historically
  featured solid growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. The
  industrial sector, initially dominated by steel, has become
  increasingly diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other
  products. Growth in the financial sector, which now accounts for
  about 28% of GDP, has more than compensated for the decline in
  steel. Most banks are foreign owned and have extensive foreign
  dealings, but Luxembourg has lost some of its advantages as a tax
  haven because of OECD and EU pressure. The economy depends on
  foreign and cross-border workers for about 60% of its labor force.
  Luxembourg, like all EU members, suffered from the global economic
  crisis that began in late 2008, but unemployment has trended below
  the EU average. Following strong expansion from 2004 to 2007,
  Luxembourg's economy contracted and 3.4% in 2009, but rebounded 2.6%
  in 2010. The country continues to enjoy an extraordinarily high
  standard of living - GDP per capita ranks third in the world, after
  Liechtenstein and Qatar, and is the highest in the EU. Turmoil in
  the world financial markets and lower global demand during 2008-09
  prompted the government to inject capital into the banking sector
  and implement stimulus measures to boost the economy. Government
  stimulus measures and support for the banking sector, however, led
  to a 5% government budget deficit in 2009, however, the deficit was
  cut below 3% in 2010.

Macau
  Macau's economy slowed dramatically in 2009 as a result of the
  global economic slowdown, but strong growth resumed in 2010, largely
  on the back of strong tourism and gaming sectors. After opening up
  its locally-controlled casino industry to foreign competition in
  2001, the territory attracted tens of billions of dollars in foreign
  investment, transforming Macau into one of the world's largest
  gaming center. Macau's gaming and tourism businesses were fueled by
  China's decision to relax travel restrictions on Chinese citizens
  wishing to visit Macau. By 2006, Macau's gaming revenue surpassed
  that of the Las Vegas strip, and gaming-related taxes accounted for
  more than 70% of total government revenue. In 2008, Macau introduced
  measures to cool the rapidly developing sector. This city of nearly
  570,000 hosted more than 21 million visitors in 2009. Almost 51%
  came from mainland China. Macau's traditional manufacturing industry
  has virtually disappeared since the termination of the Multi-Fiber
  Agreement in 2005. In 2009, total exports were less than US$1
  billion, while gaming receipts were almost US$15 billion. By October
  2010, gross gaming revenue had already reached US$19 billion for the
  year. The Macau government plans to tighten control over the opening
  of new casinos and strengthen supervision of local casino operations
  in 2011 and has introduced measures to diversify the economy. The
  Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between Macau and
  mainland China that came into effect on 1 January 2004 offers
  Macau-made products tariff-free access to the mainland;
  nevertheless, China remains Macau's third largest goods export
  market, behind Hong Kong and the United States. Macau's currency,
  the Pataca, is closely tied to the Hong Kong dollar, which is also
  freely accepted in the territory.

Macedonia
  Having a small, open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to
  economic developments in Europe and dependent on regional
  integration and progress toward EU membership for continued economic
  growth. At independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least
  developed of the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the
  total federal output of goods and services. The collapse of
  Yugoslavia ended transfer payments from the central government and
  eliminated advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area.
  An absence of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized
  Yugoslavia, and a Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the
  country's constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth
  until 1996. Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic
  stability with low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in
  attracting foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making
  extensive fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment
  remains high at 33%, but may be overstated based on the existence of
  an extensive gray market, estimated to be more than 20% of GDP, that
  is not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global
  economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign
  direct investment, lowered credit, and a large trade deficit, but
  the financial system remained sound. Macroeconomic stability was
  maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which kept the domestic
  currency at the pegged level against the euro, at the expense of
  raising interest rates. As a result, GDP fell in 2009. but returned
  to positive in 2010.

Madagascar
  After discarding socialist economic policies in the
  mid-1990s, Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of
  privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the
  start of the political crisis. This strategy placed the country on a
  slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level.
  Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the
  economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing
  80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent
  years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. However,
  Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African
  Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the
  country's duty-free access in January 2010. Deforestation and
  erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of
  fuel, are serious concerns. Former President RAVALOMANANA worked
  aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political
  crisis, which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year. The current
  political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional
  blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009,
  compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of
  entering the uncertain investment environment.

Malawi
  Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's most densely
  populated and least developed countries. The economy is
  predominately agricultural with about 80% of the population living
  in rural areas. Agriculture, which has benefited from fertilizer
  subsidies since 2006, accounts for more than one-third of GDP and
  90% of export revenues. The performance of the tobacco sector is key
  to short-term growth as tobacco accounts for more than half of
  exports. The economy depends on substantial inflows of economic
  assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and individual donor
  nations. In 2006, Malawi was approved for relief under the Heavily
  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) program. In December 2007, the US
  granted Malawi eligibility status to receive financial support
  within the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) initiative. The
  government faces many challenges including developing a market
  economy, improving educational facilities, facing up to
  environmental problems, dealing with the rapidly growing problem of
  HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors that fiscal discipline is
  being tightened. Since 2005 President MUTHARIKA'S government has
  exhibited improved financial discipline under the guidance of
  Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a three year Poverty
  Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million with the IMF.
  Improved relations with the IMF lead other international donors to
  resume aid as well. The government has announced infrastructure
  projects that could yield improvements, such as a new oil pipeline,
  for better fuel access, and the potential for a waterway link
  through Mozambican rivers to the ocean, for better transportation
  options. Since 2009, however, Malawi experienced some setbacks,
  including a general shortage of foreign exchange, which has damaged
  its ability to pay for imports, and fuel shortages that hinder
  transportation and productivity. Investment fell 23% in 2009. The
  government has failed to address barriers to investment such as
  unreliable power, water shortages, poor telecommunications
  infrastructure, and the high costs of services.

Malaysia
  Malaysia, a middle-income country, has transformed itself
  since the 1970s from a producer of raw materials into an emerging
  multi-sector economy. Under current Prime Minister NAJIB, Malaysia
  is attempting to achieve high-income status by 2020 and to move
  farther up the value-added production chain by attracting
  investments in Islamic finance, high technology industries, medical
  technology, and pharmaceuticals. The NAJIB administration also is
  continuing efforts to boost domestic demand and to wean the economy
  off of its dependence on exports. Nevertheless, exports -
  particularly of electronics - remain a significant driver of the
  economy. As an oil and gas exporter, Malaysia has profited from
  higher world energy prices, although the rising cost of domestic
  gasoline and diesel fuel, combined with strained government
  finances, has forced Kuala Lumpur to reduce government subsidies.
  The government is also trying to lessen its dependence on state oil
  producer Petronas, which supplies at least 40% of government
  revenue. The central bank maintains healthy foreign exchange
  reserves and its well-developed regulatory regime has limited
  Malaysia's exposure to riskier financial instruments and the global
  financial crisis. Nevertheless, decreasing worldwide demand for
  consumer goods hurt Malaysia's exports and economic growth in 2009,
  although both showed signs of recovery in 2010. In order to attract
  increased investment, NAJIB has also sought to revise the special
  economic and social preferences accorded to ethnic Malays under the
  New Economic Policy of 1970, but he has encountered significant
  opposition, especially from Malay nationalists.

Maldives
  Tourism, Maldives' largest economic activity, accounts for
  28% of GDP and more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts. Over 90%
  of government tax revenue comes from import duties and
  tourism-related taxes. Fishing is the second leading sector.
  Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the
  economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land
  and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be
  imported. The Maldivian Government implemented economic reforms,
  beginning in 1989 that initially lifted import quotas, opened some
  exports to the private sector, and liberalized regulations to allow
  more foreign investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year
  for more than a decade, and registered 18% in 2006, due to a rebound
  in tourism and reconstruction following the tsunami of December
  2004. GDP slowed in 2007-08, then contracted in 2009 due to the
  global recession. Falling tourist arrivals and fish exports,
  combined with high government spending on social needs, subsidies,
  and civil servant salaries contributed to a balance of payments
  crisis, which was eased with a December 2009, $79.3 million dollar
  IMF standby agreement. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and
  fishing, reforming public finance, and increasing employment
  opportunities are major challenges facing the government. Over the
  longer term Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion
  and possible global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the
  area is 1 meter or less above sea level.

Mali
  Among the 25 poorest countries in the world, Mali is a
  landlocked country highly dependent on gold mining and agricultural
  exports for revenue. The country's fiscal status fluctuates with
  gold and agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains
  dependent on foreign aid. Economic activity is largely confined to
  the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its
  land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is
  nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and
  fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm
  commodities. The government has continued an IMF-recommended
  structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow,
  diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali is developing its
  cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue
  sources because gold production has started to fall. Mali has
  invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry.
  Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the
  CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5%
  average in 1996-2010. Worker remittances and external trade routes
  for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest
  in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire, however, Mali is building a road
  network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a
  railway line to Senegal. In 2010, Mali experienced a regional
  drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods.

Malta
  Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited
  fresh water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta's
  geographic position between the EU and Africa makes it a target for
  illegal immigration, which has strained Malta's political and
  economic resources. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008.
  Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and in
  2008-09 it escaped significant damage from the international
  financial crisis, largely because the sector is centered on the
  indigenous real estate market and is not highly leveraged. Locally,
  the restricted damage from the financial crisis has been attributed
  to the stability of the Maltese banking system and to its prudent
  risk-management practices. The global economic downturn and high
  electricity and water prices hurt Malta's real economy, which is
  dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing - especially electronics
  and pharmaceuticals - and tourism, but growth bounced back as the
  global economy recovered in 2010. Following a 1.2% contraction in
  2009, GDP grew 2% in 2010.

Marshall Islands
  US Government assistance is the mainstay of this
  tiny island economy. The Marshall Islands received more than $1
  billion in aid from the US from 1986-2002. Agricultural production,
  primarily subsistence, is concentrated on small farms; the most
  important commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit. Small-scale
  industry is limited to handicrafts, tuna processing, and copra. The
  tourist industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing
  less than 10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future
  added income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports
  far exceed exports. Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free
  Association, the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the
  Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a Trust Fund made
  up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts.
  Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline
  in tourism, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel
  licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past
  decade.

Mauritania
  Half the population still depends on agriculture and
  livestock for a livelihood, even though many of the nomads and
  subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent
  droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits
  of iron ore, which account for nearly 40% of total exports. The
  nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the
  world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source
  of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
  Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000, drought and economic mismanagement
  resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In February 2000, Mauritania
  qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
  (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of its foreign debt has since been
  forgiven. A new investment code approved in December 2001 improved
  the opportunities for direct foreign investment. Mauritania and the
  IMF agreed to a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
  (PRGF) arrangement in 2006. Mauritania made satisfactory progress,
  but the IMF, World Bank, and other international actors suspended
  assistance and investment in Mauritania after the August 2008 coup.
  Since the presidential election in July 2009, donors have resumed
  assistance. Oil prospects, while initially promising, have largely
  failed to materialize, and the government has placed a priority on
  attracting private investment to spur economic growth. The
  Government also emphasizes reduction of poverty, improvement of
  health and education, and privatization of the economy.

Mauritius
  Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a
  low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income
  diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist
  sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order
  of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more
  equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered
  infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy
  rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial
  services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and
  communications technology, and hospitality and property development.
  Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and
  accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development
  strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of
  development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than
  32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South
  Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has
  reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector,
  has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and
  Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and
  prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects from
  the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew 3.6% in 2010 and
  the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach
  around the globe.

Mayotte
  Economic activity is based primarily on the agricultural
  sector, including fishing and livestock raising. Mayotte is not self
  sufficient and must import a large portion of its food requirements,
  mainly from France. The economy and future development of the island
  are heavily dependent on French financial assistance, an important
  supplement to GDP. Mayotte's remote location is an obstacle to the
  development of tourism.

Mexico
  Mexico has a free market economy in the trillion dollar
  class. It contains a mixture of modern and outmoded industry and
  agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. Recent
  administrations have expanded competition in seaports, railroads,
  telecommunications, electricity generation, natural gas
  distribution, and airports. Per capita income is roughly one-third
  that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal. Since
  the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement
  (NAFTA) in 1994, Mexico's share of US imports has increased from 7%
  to 12%, and its share of Canadian imports has doubled to 5%. Mexico
  has free trade agreements with over 50 countries including,
  Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, the European Free Trade Area, and
  Japan, putting more than 90% of trade under free trade agreements.
  In 2007, during its first year in office, the Felipe CALDERON
  administration was able to garner support from the opposition to
  successfully pass pension and fiscal reforms. The administration
  passed an energy reform measure in 2008, and another fiscal reform
  in 2009. Mexico's GDP plunged 6.5% in 2009 as world demand for
  exports dropped and asset prices tumbled, but GDP posted positive
  growth of 5% in 2010, with export growth leading the way. The
  administration continues to face many economic challenges, including
  improving the public education system, upgrading infrastructure,
  modernizing labor laws, and fostering private investment in the
  energy sector. CALDERON has stated that his top economic priorities
  remain reducing poverty and creating jobs.

Micronesia, Federated States of
  Economic activity consists primarily
  of subsistence farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral
  deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The
  potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remote location, a
  lack of adequate facilities, and limited air connections hinder
  development. Under the original terms of the Compact of Free
  Association, the US provided $1.3 billion in grant aid during the
  period 1986-2001; the level of aid has been subsequently reduced.
  The Amended Compact of Free Association with the US guarantees the
  Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) millions of dollars in annual
  aid through 2023, and establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and
  the FSM make annual contributions in order to provide annual payouts
  to the FSM in perpetuity after 2023. The country's medium-term
  economic outlook appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US
  assistance but also to the current slow growth of the private sector.

Moldova
  Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe
  despite recent progress from its small economic base. It enjoys a
  favorable climate and good farmland but has no major mineral
  deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture,
  featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import
  almost all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian
  energy was underscored at the end of 2005, when a Russian-owned
  electrical station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut
  off power to Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in
  disputes over pricing. In January 2009, gas supplies were cut during
  a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's decision to ban
  Moldovan wine and agricultural products, coupled with its decision
  to double the price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas, have hurt
  growth. The onset of the global financial crisis and poor economic
  conditions in Moldova's main foreign markets, caused GDP to fall
  6.5% in 2009. Unemployment almost doubled and inflation disappeared
  - at -0.1%, a record low. Moldova's IMF agreement expired in May
  2009. In fall 2009, the IMF allocated $186 million to Moldova to
  cover its immediate budgetary needs, and the government signed an
  new agreement with the IMF in January 2010 for a program worth $574
  million. In 2010, an upturn in the world economy boosted GDP growth
  to 3.1% and inflation to 7.3%. Economic reforms have been slow
  because of corruption and strong political forces backing government
  controls. Nevertheless, the government's primary goal of EU
  integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The
  granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia
  will encourage higher growth rates, but the agreements are unlikely
  to serve as a panacea, given the extent to which export success
  depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy
  has made a modest recovery, but remains vulnerable to political
  uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic
  interests, higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the
  skepticism of foreign investors as well as the presence of an
  illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.

Monaco
  Monaco, bordering France on the Mediterranean coast, is a
  popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
  climate. The principality also is a major banking center and has
  successfully sought to diversify into services and small,
  high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The state has no income
  tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
  individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies
  that have set up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a
  tax-free shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects
  stamp duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they
  can show that three-quarters of profits are generated within the
  principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's "grey
  list" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues
  to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws
  and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a
  number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the
  postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to
  those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.

Mongolia
  Economic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based
  on herding and agriculture - Mongolia's extensive mineral deposits,
  however, have attracted foreign investors. The country holds copper,
  gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten
  deposits, which account for a large part of foreign direct
  investment and government revenues. Soviet assistance, at its height
  one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at
  the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw
  Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction
  and natural disasters, as well as economic growth, because of
  reform-embracing, free-market economics and extensive privatization
  of the formerly state-run economy. Severe winters and summer
  droughts in 2000-02 resulted in massive livestock die-off and zero
  or negative GDP growth. This was compounded by falling prices for
  Mongolia's primary sector exports and widespread opposition to
  privatization. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely
  because of high copper prices and new gold production. In 2008
  Mongolia experienced a soaring inflation rate with year-to-year
  inflation reaching nearly 30% - the highest inflation rate in over a
  decade. By late 2008, as the country began to feel the effects of
  the global financial crisis, falling commodity prices helped lower
  inflation, but also reduced government revenues and forced cuts in
  spending. In early 2009, the International Monetary Fund reached a
  $236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia, and the country has
  started to move out of the crisis. Although the banking sector
  remains unstable, the government is now enforcing stricter
  supervision regulations. In October 2009, the government passed
  long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop
  Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi mine, considered to be one of the world's
  largest untapped copper deposits. The economy grew an estimated 7%
  in 2010, largely on the strength of exports to nearby countries, and
  international reserves reached $1.6 billion in September, an all
  time high for Mongolia. Mongolia's economy continues to be heavily
  influenced by its neighbors. Mongolia purchases 95% of its petroleum
  products and a substantial amount of electric power from Russia,
  leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Trade with China
  represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China
  receives about two-thirds of Mongolia's exports. Remittances from
  Mongolians working abroad are sizable, but have fallen due to the
  economic crisis; money laundering is a growing concern. Mongolia
  joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its
  participation in regional economic and trade regimes.

Montenegro
  Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and
  from Serbia during the MILOSEVIC era and maintained its own central
  bank, adopted the Deutchmark, then the euro - rather than the
  Yugoslav dinar - as official currency, collected customs tariffs,
  and managed its own budget. The dissolution of the loose political
  union between Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate
  membership in several international financial institutions, such as
  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In January
  2007, Montenegro joined the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro is
  pursuing its own membership in the World Trade Organization and
  signed a Stabilization and Association agreement with the European
  Union in October 2007. The European Council granted candidate
  country status to Montenegro at the December 2010 session.
  Unemployment and regional disparities in development are key
  political and economic problems. Montenegro has privatized its large
  aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as well as most of its
  financial sector, and has begun to attract foreign direct investment
  in the tourism sector. The global financial crisis has had a
  significant negative impact on the economy, due to the ongoing
  credit crunch, a decline in the real estate sector, and a fall in
  aluminum exports.

Montserrat
  Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995, has
  put a damper on this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in
  June 1997 closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic
  and social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled
  the island. Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited
  the number. The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the
  lack of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops.
  Prospects for the economy depend largely on developments in relation
  to the volcanic activity and on public sector construction activity.
  The UK has launched a three-year $122.8 million aid program to help
  reconstruct the economy. Half of the island is expected to remain
  uninhabitable for another decade.

Morocco
  Morocco's market economy benefits from the country's
  relatively low labor costs and proximity to Europe, which aid key
  areas of the economy such as agriculture, light manufacturing,
  tourism, and remittances. Morocco is also the world's largest
  exporter of phosphate, which has long provided a source of export
  earnings and economic stability. Economic policies pursued since
  2003 by King MOHAMMED VI have brought macroeconomic stability to the
  country with generally low inflation, improved financial
  performance, and steady progress in developing the service and
  industrial sectors. In 2006, Morocco entered a Free Trade Agreement
  (FTA) with the US, and in 2008 entered into an advanced status in
  its 2000 Association Agreement with the EU. However, poverty,
  illiteracy, and unemployment rates remain high. In response to these
  challenges, King MOHAMMED in 2005 launched a National Initiative for
  Human Development, a $2 billion program aimed at alleviating poverty
  and underdevelopment by expanding electricity to rural areas and
  replacing urban slums with public and subsidized housing, among
  other policies. Morocco's trade and budget deficits widened in 2010,
  and reducing govenment spending and adapting to sluggish economic
  growth in Europe will be challenges in 2011. Morocco's long-term
  challenges include improving education and job prospects for young
  Moroccans, closing the disparity in wealth between the rich and the
  poor, confronting corruption, and expanding and diversifying exports
  beyond phosphates and low-value-added products.

Mozambique
  At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the
  world's poorest countries. Socialist mismanagement and a brutal
  civil war from 1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the
  government embarked on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to
  stabilize the economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance
  and with political stability since the multi-party elections in
  1994, have led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth
  rate. Fiscal reforms, including the introduction of a value-added
  tax and reform of the customs service, have improved the
  government's revenue collection abilities. In spite of these gains,
  Mozambique remains dependent upon foreign assistance for more than
  half of its annual budget, and the majority of the population
  remains below the poverty line. Subsistence agriculture continues to
  employ the vast majority of the country's work force and smallholder
  agricultural productivity and productivity growth is weak. A
  substantial trade imbalance persists although the opening of the
  Mozal aluminum smelter, the country's largest foreign investment
  project to date, has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007,
  and after years of negotiations, the government took over Portugal's
  majority share of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company, a
  dam that was not transferred to Mozambique at independence because
  of the ensuing civil war and unpaid debts. More power is needed for
  additional investment projects in titanium extraction and processing
  and garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export
  gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced
  through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily
  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is
  now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge
  Corporation (MCC) signed a Compact with Mozambique; the Compact
  entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five
  years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation, roads,
  agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to
  spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country.
  Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the decade up to
  2007, one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy
  reliance on aluminum, which accounts for about one-third of exports,
  subjects the economy to volatile international prices. The sharp
  decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered
  GDP growth by several percentage points. Despite 8.3% GDP growth in
  2010, the increasing cost of living prompted citizens to riot in
  September 2010, after bread price increases were announced. In an
  attempt to contain the cost of living, the government implemented
  subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal
  measures.

Namibia
  The economy is heavily dependent on the extraction and
  processing of minerals for export. Mining accounts for 8% of GDP,
  but provides more than 50% of foreign exchange earnings. Rich
  alluvial diamond deposits make Namibia a primary source for
  gem-quality diamonds. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of
  nonfuel minerals in Africa, the world's fifth-largest producer of
  uranium, and the producer of large quantities of lead, zinc, tin,
  silver, and tungsten. The mining sector employs only about 3% of the
  population while about 35-40% of the population depends on
  subsistence agriculture for its livelihood. Namibia normally imports
  about 50% of its cereal requirements; in drought years food
  shortages are a major problem in rural areas. A high per capita GDP,
  relative to the region, hides one of the world's most unequal income
  distributions, as shown by Namibia's GINI coefficient. The Namibian
  economy is closely linked to South Africa with the Namibian dollar
  pegged one-to-one to the South African rand. Until 2010, Namibia
  drew 40% of its budget revenues from the Southern African Customs
  Union (SACU). Increased payments from SACU put Namibia's budget into
  surplus in 2007 for the first time since independence. SACU
  allotments to Namibia increased in 2009, but will drop for 2010 and
  2011 because South Africa went into recession during the global
  economic crisis, reducing overall SACU income. Increased fish
  production and mining of zinc, copper, uranium, and silver spurred
  growth in 2003-08, but growth in recent years was undercut by poor
  fish catches, higher costs of producing metals, and the global
  recession.

Nauru
  Revenues of this tiny island have traditionally come from
  exports of phosphates now significantly depleted. An Australian
  company in 2005 entered into an agreement intended to exploit
  remaining supplies. Few other resources exist with most necessities
  being imported, mainly from Australia its former occupier and later
  major source of support. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
  replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term
  problems. Reserves of phosphates may only last until 2010 at current
  mining rates. In anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate
  deposits, substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in
  trust funds to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's
  economic future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds,
  the government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government
  has frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments.
  Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's
  refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on
  food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital
  plant is deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the
  government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive
  statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru's GDP
  varying widely.

Navassa Island
  Subsistence fishing and commercial trawling occur
  within refuge waters.

Nepal
  Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in
  the world, with almost one-quarter of its population living below
  the poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
  providing a livelihood for three-fourths of the population and
  accounting for about one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly
  involves the processing of agricultural products, including pulses,
  jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope
  for exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000
  MW of feasible capacity, but political instability hampers foreign
  investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its
  landlocked geographic location, civil strife and labor unrest, and
  its susceptibility to natural disaster.

Netherlands
  The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial
  relations, moderate unemployment and inflation, a sizable current
  account surplus, and an important role as a European transportation
  hub. Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing,
  chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly
  mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force
  but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and
  for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners,
  began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country
  has been one of the leading European nations for attracting foreign
  direct investment and is one of the four largest investors in the
  US. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the
  Netherlands' economy - which is highly open and dependent on foreign
  trade and financial services - was hard-hit by global economic
  crisis. Dutch GDP contracted 3.9% in 2009, while exports declined
  nearly 25% due to a sharp contraction in world demand. The Dutch
  financial sector has also suffered, due in part to the high exposure
  of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In response
  to turmoil in financial markets, the government nationalized two
  banks and injected billions of dollars into a third, to prevent
  further systemic risk. The government also sought to boost the
  domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering
  corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding
  export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts,
  however, resulted in a government budget deficit of nearly 4.6% of
  GDP in 2009 and 5.6% in 2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus
  of 0.7% of GDP in 2008. With unemployment weighing on private-sector
  consumption, the government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely
  to come under increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check
  while promoting economic recovery.

New Caledonia
  New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known
  nickel resources. Only a small amount of the land is suitable for
  cultivation, and food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition
  to nickel, substantial financial support from France - equal to more
  than 15% of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy.
  Substantial new investment in the nickel industry, combined with the
  recovery of global nickel prices, brightens the economic outlook for
  the next several years.

New Zealand
  Over the past 20 years the government has transformed
  New Zealand from an agrarian economy dependent on concessionary
  British market access to a more industrialized, free market economy
  that can compete globally. This dynamic growth has boosted real
  incomes - but left behind some at the bottom of the ladder - and
  broadened and deepened the technological capabilities of the
  industrial sector. Per capita income rose for ten consecutive years
  until 2007 in purchasing power parity terms, but fell in 2008-09.
  Debt-driven consumer spending drove robust growth in the first half
  of the decade, helping fuel a large balance of payments deficit that
  posed a challenge for economic managers. Inflationary pressures
  caused the central bank to raise its key rate steadily from January
  2004 until it was among the highest in the OECD in 2007-08;
  international capital inflows attracted to the high rates further
  strengthened the currency and housing market, however, aggravating
  the current account deficit. The economy fell into recession before
  the start of the global financial crisis and contracted for five
  consecutive quarters in 2008-09. In line with global peers, the
  central bank cut interest rates aggressively and the government
  developed fiscal stimulus measures. The economy posted a 1.7%
  decline in 2009, but pulled out of recession late in the year, and
  achieved 2.1% growth in 2010. Nevertheless, key trade sectors remain
  vulnerable to weak external demand. The government plans to raise
  productivity growth and develop infrastructure, while reining in
  government spending.

Nicaragua
  Nicaragua, the poorest country in Central America and the
  second poorest in the Hemisphere, has widespread underemployment and
  poverty. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has
  been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export
  opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles
  and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports, but
  increases in the minimum wage during the ORTEGA administration will
  likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. ORTEGA's
  promotion of mixed business initiatives, owned by the Nicaraguan and
  Venezuelan state oil firms, together with the weak rule of law,
  could undermine the investment climate for domestic and
  international private firms in the near-term. Nicaragua relies on
  international economic assistance to meet internal- and
  external-debt financing obligations. Foreign donors have curtailed
  this funding, however, in response to November 2008 electoral fraud.
  Managua has an IMF extended Credit Facility program, which could
  help keep the government's fiscial deficit on target during the 2011
  election year and encourage transparency in the use of Venezuelan
  off-budget loans and assistance. In early 2004, Nicaragua secured
  some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily
  Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, however, Managua still
  struggles with a high public debt burden. Nicaragua is gradually
  recovering from the global economic crisis as increased exports
  drove positive growth in 2010. The economy is expected to grow at a
  rate of about 3% in 2011.

Niger
  Niger is a landlocked, Sub-Saharan nation, whose economy
  centers on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's
  largest uranium deposits. Drought, desertification, and strong
  population growth have undercut the economy. Niger shares a common
  currency, the CFA franc, and a common central bank, the Central Bank
  of West African States (BCEAO), with seven other members of the West
  African Monetary Union. In December 2000, Niger qualified for
  enhanced debt relief under the International Monetary Fund program
  for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and concluded an agreement
  with the Fund on a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).
  Debt relief provided under the enhanced HIPC initiative
  significantly reduces Niger's annual debt service obligations,
  freeing funds for expenditures on basic health care, primary
  education, HIV/AIDS prevention, rural infrastructure, and other
  programs geared at poverty reduction. In December 2005, Niger
  received 100% multilateral debt relief from the IMF, which
  translates into the forgiveness of approximately US $86 million in
  debts to the IMF, excluding the remaining assistance under HIPC. In
  2010, the Niger economy was recovering from the effects of a 2009
  drought that reduced grain and cowpea production and decimated
  livestock herds. The economy was also hurt when the international
  community cut off non-humanitarian aid in response to TANDJA's moves
  to extend his term as president. Nearly half of the government's
  budget is derived from foreign donor resources. Future growth may be
  sustained by exploitation of oil, gold, coal, and other mineral
  resources.

Nigeria
  Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability,
  corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and poor macroeconomic
  management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms. Nigeria's
  former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its
  overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides
  95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary
  revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in
  August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the
  Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on
  economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April
  2002, after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets,
  making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris
  Club. In November 2005, Abuja won Paris Club approval for a
  debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for
  $12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of
  Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. Since 2008 the government
  has begun to show the political will to implement the
  market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernizing the
  banking system, curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage
  demands, and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of
  earnings from the oil industry. GDP rose strongly in 2007-10 because
  of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010.
  President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of
  his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements.
  Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010
  JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes
  privatization of the state-run electricity generation and
  distribution facilities. The government also is working toward
  developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads. Nigeria's
  financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic
  crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to
  strengthen that sector.

Niue
  The economy suffers from the typical Pacific island problems of
  geographic isolation, few resources, and a small population.
  Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall
  is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are
  used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government
  expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The
  agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening,
  although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists
  primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil,
  honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
  collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent
  years has suffered a serious loss of population because of
  emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the
  promotion of tourism and financial services, although the
  International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination
  of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in
  FY08/09 was US$5.7 million. Niue suffered a devastating typhoon in
  January 2004, which decimated nascent economic programs. While in
  the process of rebuilding, Niue has been dependent on foreign aid.

Norfolk Island
  Tourism, the primary economic activity, has steadily
  increased over the years and has brought a level of prosperity
  unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific islands. The agricultural
  sector has become self sufficient in the production of beef,
  poultry, and eggs.

Northern Mariana Islands
  The economy benefits substantially from
  financial assistance from the US. The rate of funding has declined
  as locally generated government revenues have grown. The key tourist
  industry employs about 50% of the work force and accounts for
  roughly one-fourth of GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual
  tourist entries have exceeded one-half million in recent years, but
  financial difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown.
  The agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms
  producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment
  production is by far the most important industry with the employment
  of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US
  under duty and quota exemptions.

Norway
  The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of welfare
  capitalism, featuring a combination of free market activity and
  government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as
  the vital petroleum sector, through large-scale state-majority-owned
  enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources -
  petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly
  dependent on the petroleum sector, which accounts for nearly half of
  exports and over 30% of state revenue. Norway is the world's
  second-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has
  slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway
  opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994;
  nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it
  contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual
  declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves almost all state
  revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest
  sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $500 billion in 2010. After
  lackluster growth of less than 1.5% in 2002-03, GDP growth picked up
  to 2.5-6.2% in 2004-07, partly due to higher oil prices. Growth fell
  to 1.8% in 2008, and the economy contracted by 1.4% in 2009 as a
  result of the slowing world economy and the drop in oil prices.

Oman
  Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on
  dwindling oil resources. Because of declining reserves, Muscat has
  actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification,
  industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing
  the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020. Tourism and
  gas-based industries are key components of the government's
  diversification strategy. By using enhanced oil recovery techniques,
  Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the country more
  time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices thoughout
  2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest
  in non-oil sectors.

Pacific Ocean
  The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
  economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.
  It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
  extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals,
  and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1996, over 60%
  of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean. Exploitation
  of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role
  in the energy supplies of the US, Australia, NZ, China, and Peru.
  The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the
  wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has led to
  fluctuations in new drillings.

Pakistan
  Pakistan, an impoverished and underdeveloped country, has
  suffered from decades of internal political disputes and low levels
  of foreign investment. Between 2001-07, however, poverty levels
  decreased by 10%, as Islamabad steadily raised development spending.
  Between 2004-07, GDP growth in the 5-8% range was spurred by gains
  in the industrial and service sectors - despite severe electricity
  shortfalls - but growth slowed in 2008-09 and unemployment rose.
  Inflation remains the top concern among the public, climbing from
  7.7% in 2007 to more than 13% in 2010. In addition, the Pakistani
  rupee has depreciated since 2007 as a result of political and
  economic instability. The government agreed to an International
  Monetary Fund Standby Arrangement in November 2008 in response to a
  balance of payments crisis, but during 2009-10 its current account
  strengthened and foreign exchange reserves stabilized - largely
  because of lower oil prices and record remittances from workers
  abroad. Record floods in July-August 2010 lowered agricultural
  output and contributed to a jump in inflation, and reconstruction
  costs will strain the limited resources of the government. Textiles
  account for most of Pakistan's export earnings, but Pakistan's
  failure to expand a viable export base for other manufactures has
  left the country vulnerable to shifts in world demand. Other long
  term challenges include expanding investment in education,
  healthcare, and electricity production, and reducing dependence on
  foreign donors.

Palau
  The economy consists primarily of tourism, subsistence
  agriculture, and fishing. The government is the major employer of
  the work force relying heavily on financial assistance from the US.
  The Compact of Free Association with the US, entered into after the
  end of the UN trusteeship on 1 October 1994, provided Palau with up
  to $700 million in US aid for the following 15 years in return for
  furnishing military facilities. Business and tourist arrivals
  numbered 85,000 in 2007. The population enjoys a per capita income
  roughly 50% higher than that of the Philippines and much of
  Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the key tourist sector have been
  greatly bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific, the
  rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries, and the
  willingness of foreigners to finance infrastructure development.

Panama
  Panama's dollarized economy rests primarily on a
  well-developed services sector that accounts for three-quarters of
  GDP. Services include operating the Panama Canal, banking, the Colon
  Free Zone, insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and
  tourism. Economic growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal
  expansion project that began in 2007 and is scheduled to be
  completed by 2014 at a cost of $5.3 billion - about 25% of current
  GDP. The expansion project will more than double the Canal's
  capacity, enabling it to accommodate ships that are now too large to
  transverse the transoceanic crossway, and should help to reduce the
  unemployment rate. The United States and China are the top users of
  the Canal. Panama also plans to construct a metro system in Panama
  City, valued at $1.2 billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014.
  Panama's aggressive infrastructure development projects will likely
  lead the economy to continued growth in 2011. Strong economic
  performance has not translated into broadly shared prosperity as
  Panama has the second worst income distribution in Latin America.
  About 30% of the population lives in poverty, however, during
  TORRIJOS's term poverty was reduced from 40% to 30% and unemployment
  dropped from 12% to 6%. Not a CAFTA signatory, Panama in December
  2006 independently negotiated a free trade agreement with the US,
  which, when implemented, will help promote the country's economic
  growth. Seeking removal from the Organization of Economic
  Development's gray-list of tax havens, Panama has also recently
  signed various double taxation treaties with other nations.

Papua New Guinea
  Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural
  resources, but exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and
  the high cost of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a
  subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits,
  including copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of
  export earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 227
  billion cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil
  company is constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production
  facility that could begin exporting in 2013 or 2014. As the largest
  investment project in the country's history, it has the potential to
  double GDP in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export
  revenue. The government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency
  and accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large
  LNG projects. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended
  much of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime
  minister ever to serve a full five-year term. The government has
  brought stability to the national budget, largely through
  expenditure control; however, it relaxed spending constraints in
  2006 and 2007 as elections approached. Numerous challenges still
  face the government, including providing physical security for
  foreign investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring
  integrity to state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by
  privatizing moribund state institutions, and balancing relations
  with Australia, its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural
  challenges could upend the economy including an HIV/AIDS epidemic,
  with the highest infection rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific,
  and chronic law and order and land tenure issues. The global
  financial crisis had little impact because of continued high demand
  for Papua New Guinea's commodities exports.

Paracel Islands
  The islands have the potential for oil and gas
  development. Waters around the islands support commercial fishing,
  but the islands themselves are not populated on a permanent basis.

Paraguay
  Landlocked Paraguay has a market economy distinguished by a
  large informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer
  goods to neighboring countries, as well as the activities of
  thousands of microenterprises and urban street vendors. A large
  percentage of the population, especially in rural areas, derives its
  living from agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis.
  Because of the importance of the informal sector, accurate economic
  measures are difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income
  has stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003
  and 2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high
  prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based
  export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the
  world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and
  slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession.
  The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity
  prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by
  introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at
  a 6.5% level in 2010. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited
  progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the
  main obstacles to growth.

Peru
  Peru's economy reflects its varied geography - an arid coastal
  region, the Andes further inland, and tropical lands bordering
  Colombia and Brazil. Abundant mineral resources are found in the
  mountainous areas, and Peru's coastal waters provide excellent
  fishing grounds. The Peruvian economy grew by more than 4% per year
  during the period 2002-06, with a stable exchange rate and low
  inflation. Growth jumped to 9% per year in 2007 and 2008, driven by
  higher world prices for minerals and metals and the government's
  aggressive trade liberalization strategies, but then fell to less
  than 1% in 2009 in the face of the world recession and lower
  commodity export prices. Growth resumed in 2010 at nearly 8%, due
  partly to increased exports. Peru's rapid expansion has helped to
  reduce the national poverty rate by about 15% since 2002, though
  underemployment remains high; inflation has trended downward in
  2009, to below the Central Bank's 1-3% target. Despite Peru's strong
  macroeconomic performance, overdependence on minerals and metals
  subjects the economy to fluctuations in world prices, and poor
  infrastructure precludes the spread of growth to Peru's non-coastal
  areas. Not all Peruvians therefore have shared in the benefits of
  growth and despite President GARCIA's pursuit of sound trade and
  macroeconomic policies, persistent inequality has cost him political
  support. Nevertheless, he remains committed to Peru's free-trade
  path. Since 2006, Peru has signed trade deals with the United
  States, Canada, Singapore, and China, concluded negotiations with
  the European Union, and begun trade talks with Korea, Japan, and
  others. The US-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA) entered into
  force 1 February 2009, opening the way to greater trade and
  investment between the two economies.

Philippines
  Philippine GDP grew nearly 7% in 2010. The economy
  weathered the 2008-09 global recession better than its regional
  peers due to minimal exposure to securities issued by troubled
  global financial institutions; lower dependence on exports;
  relatively resilient domestic consumption, supported by large
  remittances from four-to five-million overseas Filipino workers; and
  a growing business process outsourcing industry. Economic growth in
  the Philippines has averaged 4.5% per year since 2001, when former
  President MACAPAGAL-ARROYO took office. Despite this growth, poverty
  worsened during the term of MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, because of a high
  population growth rate and inequitable distribution of income.
  MACAPAGAL-ARROYO averted a fiscal crisis by pushing for new revenue
  measures and, until recently, tightening expenditures to address the
  government's yawning budget deficit and to reduce high debt and debt
  service ratios. But the government abandoned its 2008
  balanced-budget goal in order to help the economy weather the global
  financial and economic storm. The economy under AQUINO faces budget
  shortfalls in the near term, but has had little difficulty issuing
  debt both locally and internationally to finance the deficits.
  AQUINO's first budget emphasizes education and other social spending
  programs, relying on the private sector to finance important
  infrastructure projects. Weak tax collection in recent years limits
  the government's ability to address major challenges.

Pitcairn Islands
  The inhabitants of this tiny isolated economy exist
  on fishing, subsistence farming, handicrafts, and postage stamps.
  The fertile soil of the valleys produces a wide variety of fruits
  and vegetables, including citrus, sugarcane, watermelons, bananas,
  yams, and beans. Bartering is an important part of the economy. The
  major sources of revenue are the sale of postage stamps to
  collectors and the sale of handicrafts to passing ships. In October
  2004, more than one-quarter of Pitcairn's small labor force was
  arrested, putting the economy in a bind, since their services were
  required as lighter crew to load or unload passing ships.

Poland
  Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since
  1990 and today stands out as a success story among transition
  economies. Before 2009, GDP had grown about 5% annually, based on
  rising private consumption, a jump in corporate investment, and EU
  funds inflows. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average,
  but is similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004, EU
  membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major
  boost to the economy. Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4% in October
  2008, but climbed back to 11.8% for the year 2010, exceeding the EU
  average by more than 2%. In 2008 inflation reached 4.2%, more than
  the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target range, but
  fell to 2.4% in 2010 due to global economic slowdown. Poland's
  economic performance could improve over the longer term if the
  country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and
  rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient
  commercial court system, a rigid labor code, bureaucratic red tape,
  burdensome tax system, and persistent low-level corruption keep the
  private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising
  demands to fund health care, education, and the state pension system
  caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9% of GDP in
  2010. The PO/PSL coalition government, which came to power in
  November 2007, plans to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has
  also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms,
  increase workforce participation, reduce public sector spending
  growth, lower taxes, and accelerate privatization. The government,
  however, has moved slowly on major reforms. The legislature passed a
  law significantly limiting early retirement benefits. A health-care
  bill also passed through the legislature, but the legislature failed
  to overturn a presidential veto.

Portugal
  Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly
  service-based economy since joining the European Community in 1986.
  Over the past two decades, successive governments have privatized
  many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the
  economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The
  country qualified for the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and
  began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU
  member economies. Economic growth had been above the EU average for
  much of the 1990s, but fell back in 2001-08, shrank 2.6% in 2009,
  before growing 1% in 2010. GDP per capita stands at roughly
  two-thirds of the EU-27 average. A poor educational system and a
  rigid labor market have been obstacles to greater productivity and
  growth. Portugal also has been increasingly overshadowed by
  lower-cost producers in Central Europe and Asia as a target for
  foreign direct investment. Portugal's competitiveness problems, low
  growth prospects, and high levels of public debt have made it
  vulnerable to bond market turbulence. Lisbon is implementing
  austerity measures to reduce the budget deficit from 9.4% of GDP in
  2009 to 4.6% of GDP in 2011, but some investors have expressed
  concern about Portugal's ability to achieve these targets and cover
  its sovereign debt. Without the option for stimulus measures, the
  government is focusing instead on boosting exports and implementing
  labor market reforms to try to raise GDP growth and tackle
  Portugal's competitiveness problems, which may help mitigate
  investor concerns over time.

Puerto Rico
  Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the
  Caribbean region. A diverse industrial sector has far surpassed
  agriculture as the primary locus of economic activity and income.
  Encouraged by duty-free access to the US and by tax incentives, US
  firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US
  minimum wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
  production and other livestock products as the main source of income
  in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an
  important source of income with estimated arrivals of more than 3.6
  million tourists in 2008.

Qatar
  Despite the global financial crisis, Qatar has prospered in
  the last several years - in 2010 Qatar had the world's highest
  growth rate. Qatari authorities throughout the crisis sought to
  protect the local banking sector with direct investments into
  domestic banks. GDP rebounded in 2010 largely due to the increase in
  oil prices. Economic policy is focused on developing Qatar's
  nonassociated natural gas reserves and increasing private and
  foreign investment in non-energy sectors, but oil and gas still
  account for more than 50% of GDP, roughly 85% of export earnings,
  and 70% of government revenues. Oil and gas have made Qatar the
  second highest per-capita income country - following Liechtenstein -
  and likely the country with the lowest unemployment. Proved oil
  reserves of 15 billion barrels should enable continued output at
  current levels for 37 years. Qatar's proved reserves of natural gas
  exceed 25 trillion cubic meters, about 14% of the world total and
  third largest in the world. Qatar's successful 2022 world cup bid
  will likely accelerate large-scale infrastructure projects such as
  Qatar's metro system and the Qatar-Bahrain causeway.

Romania
  Romania, which joined the European Union on 1 January 2007,
  began the transition from Communism in 1989 with a largely obsolete
  industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the country's
  needs. The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year
  recession thanks to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic
  consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent
  years, but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's
  macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a
  middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption
  and red tape continue to handicap its business environment.
  Inflation rose in 2007-08, driven in part by strong consumer demand
  and high wage growth, rising energy costs, a nation-wide drought
  affecting food prices, and a relaxation of fiscal discipline.
  Romania's GDP contracted markedly in the last quarter of 2008 as the
  country began to feel the effects of a global downturn in financial
  markets and trade, and GDP fell more than 7% in 2009, prompting
  Bucharest to seek a $26 billion emergency assistance package from
  the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. Drastic austerity
  measures, as part of Romania's IMF-led agreement led to a further
  1.9% GDP contraction in 2010. The economy is expected to return to
  positive growth in 2011.

Russia
  Russia has undergone significant changes since the collapse
  of the Soviet Union, moving from a globally-isolated,
  centrally-planned economy to a more market-based and
  globally-integrated economy. Economic reforms in the 1990s
  privatized most industry, with notable exceptions in the energy and
  defense-related sectors. The protection of property rights is still
  weak and the private sector remains subject to heavy state
  interference. Russian industry is primarily split between
  globally-competitive commodity producers - in 2009 Russia was the
  world's largest exporter of natural gas, the second largest exporter
  of oil, and the third largest exporter of steel and primary aluminum
  - and other less competitive heavy industries that remain dependent
  on the Russian domestic market. This reliance on commodity exports
  makes Russia vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the
  highly volatile swings in global commodity prices. The government
  since 2007 has embarked on an ambitious program to reduce this
  dependency and build up the country's high technology sectors, but
  with few results so far. The economy had averaged 7% growth since
  the 1998 Russian financial crisis, resulting in a doubling of real
  disposable incomes and the emergence of a middle class. The Russian
  economy, however, was one of the hardest hit by the 2008-09 global
  economic crisis as oil prices plummeted and the foreign credits that
  Russian banks and firms relied on dried up. The Central Bank of
  Russia spent one-third of its $600 billion international reserves,
  the world's third largest, in late 2008 to slow the devaluation of
  the ruble. The government also devoted $200 billion in a rescue plan
  to increase liquidity in the banking sector and aid Russian firms
  unable to roll over large foreign debts coming due. The economic
  decline bottomed out in mid-2009 and the economy began to grow in
  the first quarter of 2010. However, a severe drought and fires in
  central Russia reduced agricultural output, prompting a ban on grain
  exports for part of the year, and slowed growth in other sectors
  such as manufacturing and retail trade. Russia's long-term
  challenges include a shrinking workforce, a high level of
  corruption, difficulty in accessing capital for smaller, non-energy
  companies, and poor infrastructure in need of large investments.

Rwanda
  Rwanda is a poor rural country with about 90% of the
  population engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture and some
  mineral and agro-processing. In 2008, minerals overtook coffee and
  tea as Rwanda's primary foreign exchange earner. The 1994 genocide
  decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the
  population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the
  country's ability to attract private and external investment.
  However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and
  rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded and
  inflation has been curbed. Nonetheless, a majority still live below
  the poverty line of 250 Rwandan francs per day (about US$0.43).
  Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not
  keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Rwanda continues to
  receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily
  Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06.
  Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Account Compact in 2008.
  Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the
  limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional
  trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its
  budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners.
  The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce
  poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and
  domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms, although
  energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of
  adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to
  handicap growth. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism,
  but economic growth is recovering, driven in large part by the
  services sector, and inflation has been contained. On the back of
  this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus
  policy while protecting aid to the poor.

Saint Barthelemy
  The economy of Saint Barthelemy is based upon
  high-end tourism and duty-free luxury commerce, serving visitors
  primarily from North America. The luxury hotels and villas host
  70,000 visitors each year with another 130,000 arriving by boat. The
  relative isolation and high cost of living inhibits mass tourism.
  The construction and public sectors also enjoy significant
  investment in support of tourism. With limited fresh water
  resources, all food must be imported, as must all energy resources
  and most manufactured goods. Employment is strong and attracts labor
  from Brazil and Portugal.

Saint Helena, Ascension, and Tristan da Cunha
  The economy depends
  largely on financial assistance from the UK, which amounted to about
  $27 million in FY06/07 or more than twice the level of annual
  budgetary revenues. The local population earns income from fishing,
  raising livestock, and sales of handicrafts. Because there are few
  jobs, 25% of the work force has left to seek employment on Ascension
  Island, on the Falklands, and in the UK.

Saint Kitts and Nevis
  The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is
  heavily dependent upon tourism revenues, which has replaced sugar,
  the traditional mainstay of the economy until the 1970s. Following
  the 2005 harvest, the government closed the sugar industry after
  decades of losses of 3-4% of GDP annually. To compensate for
  employment losses, the government has embarked on a program to
  diversify the agricultural sector and to stimulate other sectors of
  the economy, such as tourism, export-oriented manufacturing, and
  offshore banking. More than 200,000 tourists visited the islands in
  2009. Like other tourist destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts
  and Nevis is vulnerable to damage from natural disasters and shifts
  in tourism demand. The current government is constrained by one of
  the world's highest public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185%
  of GDP, largely attributable to public enterprise losses.

Saint Lucia
  The island nation has been able to attract foreign
  business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and
  tourism industries, with a surge in foreign direct investment in
  2006, attributed to the construction of several tourism projects.
  Although crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be
  grown for export, tourism provides Saint Lucia's main source of
  income and the industry is the island's biggest employer. Tourism is
  the main source of foreign exchange, although tourism sector
  revenues declined with the global economic downturn as US and
  European travel dropped in 2009. The manufacturing sector is the
  most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is
  trying to revitalize the banana industry, although recent hurricanes
  have caused exports to contract. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a
  variety of external shocks including volatile tourism receipts,
  natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. The public
  debt-to-GDP ratio is about 77% and high debt servicing obligations
  constrain the KING administration's ability to respond to adverse
  external shocks. Economic fundamentals remain solid, even though
  unemployment needs to be reduced.

Saint Martin
  The economy of Saint Martin centers around tourism with
  85% of the labor force engaged in this sector. Over one million
  visitors come to the island each year with most arriving through the
  Princess Juliana International Airport in Sint Maarten. No
  significant agriculture and limited local fishing means that almost
  all food must be imported. Energy resources and manufactured goods
  are also imported, primarily from Mexico and the United States.
  Saint Martin is reported to have the highest per capita income in
  the Caribbean.

Saint Pierre and Miquelon
  The inhabitants have traditionally earned
  their livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets
  operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been
  declining, however, because of disputes with Canada over fishing
  quotas and a steady decline in the number of ships stopping at Saint
  Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration panel awarded the islands an
  exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km to settle a longstanding
  territorial dispute with Canada, although it represents only 25% of
  what France had sought. France heavily subsidizes the islands to the
  great betterment of living standards. The government hopes an
  expansion of tourism will boost economic prospects. Fish farming,
  crab fishing, and agriculture are being developed to diversify the
  local economy. Recent test drilling for oil may pave the way for
  development of the energy sector.

Saint Vincent and the Grenadines
  Success of the economy hinges upon
  seasonal variations in agriculture, tourism, and construction
  activity as well as remittance inflows. Much of the workforce is
  employed in banana production and tourism, but persistent high
  unemployment has prompted many to leave the islands. This
  lower-middle-income country is vulnerable to natural disasters -
  tropical storms wiped out substantial portions of crops in 1994,
  1995, and 2002. In 2008, the islands had more than 200,000 tourist
  arrivals, mostly to the Grenadines, a drop of nearly 20% from 2007.
  Saint Vincent is home to a small offshore banking sector and has
  moved to adopt international regulatory standards. The government's
  ability to invest in social programs and respond to external shocks
  is constrained by its high public debt burden, which was over 90% of
  GDP at the end of 2010. Following the global downturn, St. Vincent
  and the Grenadines saw an economic decline in 2009, after slowing
  since 2006, when GDP growth reached a 10-year high of nearly 7%. The
  GONSALVES administration is directing government resources to
  infrastructure projects, including a new international airport that
  is expected to be completed in 2011.

Samoa
  The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on
  development aid, family remittances from overseas, agriculture, and
  fishing. The country is vulnerable to devastating storms.
  Agriculture employs two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90%
  of exports, featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The
  manufacturing sector mainly processes agricultural products. One
  factory in the Foreign Trade Zone employs 3,000 people to make
  automobile electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia.
  Tourism is an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 122,000
  tourists visited the islands in 2007. In late September 2009, an
  earthquake and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and
  nearby American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power
  generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The Samoan Government
  has called for deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement
  of investment, and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same
  time protecting the environment. Observers point to the flexibility
  of the labor market as a basic strength for future economic
  advances. Foreign reserves are in a relatively healthy state, the
  external debt is stable, and inflation is low.

San Marino
  San Marino's economy relies heavily on its tourism and
  banking industries, as well as on the manufacture and export of
  ceramics, clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and
  wine. The per capita level of output and standard of living are
  comparable to those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which
  supplies much of its food. San Marino boasts the world's longest
  life expectancy for men with 80 years. The economy benefits from
  foreign investment due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low
  taxes on interest earnings. San Marino has recently faced increased
  international pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax
  authorities and transparency within its own banking sector, which
  generates about one-fifth of the country's tax revenues. Italy's
  implementation in October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate
  untaxed funds held abroad has resulted in financial outflows from
  San Marino to Italy worth more than $4.5 billion. Such outflows,
  combined with a money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest
  financial institution and the recent global economic downturn, have
  contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit. However,
  San Marino has no national debt, and an unemployment rate half the
  size of Italy's. The San Marino government has adopted measures to
  counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San
  Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws
  with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the
  OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to
  fully implement global tax standards.

Sao Tome and Principe
  This small, poor island economy has become
  increasingly dependent on cocoa since independence in 1975. Cocoa
  production has substantially declined in recent years because of
  drought and mismanagement. Sao Tome and Principe has to import all
  fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer goods, and a substantial
  amount of food. Over the years, it has had difficulty servicing its
  external debt and has relied heavily on concessional aid and debt
  rescheduling. Sao Tome and Principe benefited from $200 million in
  debt relief in December 2000 under the Highly Indebted Poor
  Countries (HIPC) program, which helped bring down the country's $300
  million debt burden. In August 2005, the government signed on to a
  new 3-year IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program
  worth $4.3 million. Considerable potential exists for development of
  a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to expand
  facilities in recent years. The government also has attempted to
  reduce price controls and subsidies. Potential exists for the
  development of petroleum resources in Sao Tome and Principe's
  territorial waters in the oil-rich Gulf of Guinea, which are being
  jointly developed in a 60-40 split with Nigeria, but any actual
  production is at least several years off. The first production
  licenses were sold in 2004, though a dispute over licensing with
  Nigeria delayed the country's receipt of more than $20 million in
  signing bonuses for almost a year.

Saudi Arabia
  Saudi Arabia has an oil-based economy with strong
  government controls over major economic activities. It possesses
  about 20% of the world's proven petroleum reserves, ranks as the
  largest exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. The
  petroleum sector accounts for roughly 80% of budget revenues, 45% of
  GDP, and 90% of export earnings. Saudi Arabia is encouraging the
  growth of the private sector in order to diversify its economy and
  to employ more Saudi nationals. Diversification efforts are focusing
  on power generation, telecommunications, natural gas exploration,
  and petrochemical sectors. Almost 6 million foreign workers play an
  important role in the Saudi economy, particularly in the oil and
  service sectors, while Riyadh is struggling to reduce unemployment
  among its own nationals. Saudi officials are particularly focused on
  employing its large youth population, which generally lacks the
  education and technical skills the private sector needs. Riyadh has
  substantially boosted spending on job training and education, most
  recently with the opening of the King Abdallah University of Science
  and Technology - Saudi Arabia's first co-educational university. As
  part of its effort to attract foreign investment, Saudi Arabia
  acceded to the WTO in December 2005 after many years of
  negotiations. The government has begun establishing six "economic
  cities" in different regions of the country to promote foreign
  investment and plans to spend $373 billion between 2010 and 2014 on
  social development and infrastructure projects to advance Saudi
  Arabia's economic development.

Senegal
  Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance. The country's
  key export industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production,
  and commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and
  oil exploration projects. In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold
  and ambitious economic reform program with the support of the
  international donor community. Government price controls and
  subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy
  contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround,
  thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging over
  5% annually during 1995-2008. Annual inflation had been pushed down
  to the single digits. The country was adversely affected by the
  global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2%. As a
  member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
  Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a
  unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High
  unemployment, however, continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee
  Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Under the
  IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program,
  Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral,
  multilateral, and private-sector debt. In 2007, Senegal and the IMF
  agreed to a new, non-disbursing, Policy Support Initiative program
  which was completed in 2010. Senegal received its first disbursement
  from the $540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed
  in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development. In
  2010, the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts.
  The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote
  renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity, more protests
  are likely and economic activity will be hindered. During the year,
  bakers protested government price controls on bread. Foreign
  investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal's business
  environment, which has slipped in recent years, and by perceptions
  of corruption.

Serbia
  MILOSEVIC-era mismanagement of the economy, an extended
  period of international economic sanctions, and the damage to
  Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry during the NATO airstrikes
  in 1999 left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. After
  the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President MILOSEVIC in
  September 2000, the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition
  government implemented stabilization measures and embarked on a
  market reform program. After renewing its membership in the IMF in
  December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate into the
  international community by rejoining the World Bank (IBRD) and the
  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). Belgrade
  has made progress in trade liberalization and enterprise
  restructuring and privatization, including telecommunications and
  small- and medium-size firms. It has made some progress towards EU
  membership, signing a Stabilization and Association Agreement with
  Brussels in May 2008, and with full implementation of the Interim
  Trade Agreement with the EU in February 2010. Serbia is also
  pursuing membership in the World Trade Organization. Reforms needed
  to ensure the country's long-term viability have largely stalled
  since the onset of the global financial crisis. Serbia is grappling
  with fallout from crisis, which has led to a sharp drop in exports
  to Western Europe and a decline in manufacturing output.
  Unemployment and limited export earnings remain ongoing political
  and economic problems. Serbia signed an augmented $4 billion Stand
  By Arrangement with the IMF in May 2009. IMF conditions on Serbia
  constrain the use of stimulus efforts to revive the economy, while
  Serbia's concerns about inflation and exchange rate stability
  preclude the use of expansionary monetary policy. Serbia's economy
  grew by 1.8% in 2010 after a 3% contraction in 2009 as a recovery in
  Western Europe began.

Seychelles
  Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this
  Indian Ocean archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
  pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the
  upper-middle income group of countries. Growth has been led by the
  tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and
  provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna
  fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign
  investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time,
  the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by
  promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale
  manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07, driven by
  tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles
  rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for
  years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these
  actions, the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains
  and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks, a foreign
  exchange shortage, high inflation, large financing gaps, and the
  global recession. In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro
  amortizing note worth roughly US$80 million, leading to a
  downgrading of Seychelles credit rating, but in October 2010 the EU
  approved a $2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program
  for Seychelles. In response to Seychelles successful implementation
  of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the IMF upgraded Seychelles
  to a three-year exteneded fund facility (EFF) of $31 million in
  December 2009. In 2008, GDP fell more than 1% due to declining
  tourism, but the economy recovered in 2009-10 with a notable
  increase in tourist numbers for 2010.

Sierra Leone
  Sierra Leone is an extremely poor nation with
  tremendous inequality in income distribution. While it possesses
  substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, its
  physical and social infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil
  war, and serious social disorders continue to hamper economic
  development. Nearly half of the working-age population engages in
  subsistence agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the
  processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the
  domestic market. Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of
  hard currency earnings accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's
  exports. The fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of
  domestic peace and the continued receipt of substantial aid from
  abroad, which is essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and
  supplement government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty
  Reduction and Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic
  growth and reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth
  $45 million over three years. Political stability has led to a
  revival of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite
  and rutile mining, which are set to benefit from planned tax
  incentives. A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in
  2009 and 2010. The development on these reserves, which could be
  significant, is still several years away.

Singapore
  Singapore has a highly developed and successful
  free-market economy. It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free
  environment, stable prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of
  most developed countries. The economy depends heavily on exports,
  particularly in consumer electronics, information technology
  products, pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services
  sector. Real GDP growth averaged 6.9% between 2004 and 2008. The
  economy contracted 1.3% in 2009 as a result of the global financial
  crisis, but rebounded nearly 15% in 2010, on the strength of renewed
  exports. Over the longer term, the government hopes to establish a
  new growth path that focuses on raising productivity growth, which
  has sunk to 1% per year in the last decade. Singapore has attracted
  major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology
  production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as
  Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.

Sint Maarten
  The economy of Sint Maarten centers around tourism with
  nearly four-fifths of the labor force engaged in this sector. Over
  one million visitors come to the island each year - 1.3 million in
  2008 - with most arriving through the Princess Juliana International
  Airport. Cruise ships and yachts also call on Sint Maarten's
  numerous ports and harbors. No significant agriculture and limited
  local fishing means that almost all food must be imported. Energy
  resources and manufactured goods are also imported. Sint Maarten had
  the highest per capita income among the five islands that formerly
  comprised the Netherlands Antilles.

Slovakia
  Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its
  separation from the Czech Republic in 1993. Reforms to the taxation,
  healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia to
  consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and
  to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly
  complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands,
  and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom
  with business friendly policies such as labor market liberalization
  and a 19% flat tax. Foreign investment in the automotive and
  electronic sectors has been strong. Slovakia's economic growth
  exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite the general European
  slowdown. Unemployment, at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04, dropped
  to 7.7% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. FICO's
  cabinet was careful to keep a lid on spending in order to meet euro
  adoption criteria and has focused on regulating energy and food
  prices instead. To maintain a stable operating environment for
  investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
  advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in
  important sectors of the economy. However, Bratislava's approach to
  mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government
  intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies.
  Slovakia was admitted to the euro zone in January 2009. RADICOVA's
  government, in power since July 2010, has allowed the budget deficit
  to rise slightly, to 8.2% of GDP in 2010. GDP fell nearly 5% in 2009
  before gaining back 4% in 2010, and unemployment rose above 12% in
  2010, as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy.

Slovenia
  Slovenia became the first 2004 European Union entrant to
  adopt the euro (on 1 January 2007) and has become a model of
  economic success and stability for the region. With the highest per
  capita GDP in Central Europe, Slovenia has excellent infrastructure,
  a well-educated work force, and a strategic location between the
  Balkans and Western Europe. Privatization has lagged since 2002, and
  the economy has one of highest levels of state control in the EU.
  Structural reforms to improve the business environment have allowed
  for somewhat greater foreign participation in Slovenia's economy and
  have helped to lower unemployment. In March 2004, Slovenia became
  the first transition country to graduate from borrower status to
  donor partner at the World Bank. In December 2007, Slovenia was
  invited to begin the accession process for joining the OECD. Despite
  its economic success, foreign direct investment (FDI) in Slovenia
  has lagged behind the region average, and taxes remain relatively
  high. Furthermore, the labor market is often seen as inflexible, and
  legacy industries are losing sales to more competitive firms in
  China, India, and elsewhere. In 2009, the world recession caused the
  economy to contract - through falling exports and industrial
  production - by more than 8%, and unemployment to rise above 9%.
  Although growth resumed in 2010, the unemployment rate continued to
  rise, topping 10%.

Solomon Islands
  The bulk of the population depends on agriculture,
  fishing, and forestry for at least part of its livelihood. Most
  manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The
  islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead,
  zinc, nickel, and gold. Prior to the arrival of RAMSI, severe ethnic
  violence, the closing of key businesses, and an empty government
  treasury culminated in economic collapse. RAMSI's efforts to restore
  law and order and economic stability have led to modest growth as
  the economy rebuilds.

Somalia
  Despite the lack of effective national governance, Somalia
  has maintained a healthy informal economy, largely based on
  livestock, remittance/money transfer companies, and
  telecommunications. Agriculture is the most important sector with
  livestock normally accounting for about 40% of GDP and more than 50%
  of export earnings. Nomads and semi-pastoralists, who are dependent
  upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion of the
  population. Livestock, hides, fish, charcoal, and bananas are
  Somalia's principal exports, while sugar, sorghum, corn, qat, and
  machined goods are the principal imports. Somalia's small industrial
  sector, based on the processing of agricultural products, has
  largely been looted and the machinery sold as scrap metal. Somalia's
  service sector also has grown. Telecommunication firms provide
  wireless services in most major cities and offer the lowest
  international call rates on the continent. In the absence of a
  formal banking sector, money transfer/remittance services have
  sprouted throughout the country, handling up to $1.6 billion in
  remittances annually. Mogadishu's main market offers a variety of
  goods from food to the newest electronic gadgets. Hotels continue to
  operate and are supported with private-security militias. Due to
  armed attacks on and threats to humanitarian aid workers, the World
  Food Programme partially suspended its operations in southern
  Somalia in early January 2010 pending improvement in the security
  situation. Somalia's arrears to the IMF have continued to grow.

South Africa
  South Africa is a middle-income, emerging market with
  an abundant supply of natural resources; well-developed financial,
  legal, communications, energy, and transport sectors; a stock
  exchange that is the 18th largest in the world; and modern
  infrastructure supporting a relatively efficient distribution of
  goods to major urban centers throughout the region. At the end of
  2007, South Africa began to experience an electricity crisis. State
  power supplier Eskom encountered problems with aged plants,
  necessitating "load-shedding" cuts to residents and businesses in
  the major cities. Growth was robust from 2004 to 2007 as South
  Africa reaped the benefits of macroeconomic stability and a global
  commodities boom, but began to slow in the second half of 2007 due
  to the electricity crisis and the subsequent global financial
  crisis' impact on commodity prices and demand. GDP fell nearly 2% in
  2009. Unemployment remains high and outdated infrastructure has
  constrained growth. Daunting economic problems remain from the
  apartheid era - especially poverty, lack of economic empowerment
  among the disadvantaged groups, and a shortage of public
  transportation. South Africa's former economic policy was fiscally
  conservative, focusing on controlling inflation, and attaining a
  budget surplus. The current government largely follows the same
  prudent policies, but must contend with the impact of the global
  crisis and is facing growing pressure from special interest groups
  to use state-owned enterprises to deliver basic services to
  low-income areas and to increase job growth. More than one-quarter
  of South Africa's population currently receives social grants.

South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands
  Some fishing takes place in
  adjacent waters. There is a potential source of income from
  harvesting finfish and krill. The islands receive income from
  postage stamps produced in the UK, sale of fishing licenses, and
  harbor and landing fees from tourist vessels. Tourism from
  specialized cruise ships is increasing rapidly.

Southern Ocean
  Fisheries in 2006-07 landed 126,976 metric tons, of
  which 82% (104,586 tons) was krill (Euphausia superba) and 9.5%
  (12,027 tons) Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides - also
  known as Chilean sea bass), compared to 127,910 tons in 2005-06 of
  which 83% (106,591 tons) was krill and 9.7% (12,396 tons) Patagonian
  toothfish (estimated fishing from the area covered by the Convention
  of the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR),
  which extends slightly beyond the Southern Ocean area).
  International agreements were adopted in late 1999 to reduce
  illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, which in the 2000-01
  season landed, by one estimate, 8,376 metric tons of Patagonian and
  Antarctic toothfish. In the 2007-08 Antarctic summer, 45,213
  tourists visited the Southern Ocean, compared to 35,552 in
  2006-2007, and 29,799 in 2005-2006 (estimates provided to the
  Antarctic Treaty by the International Association of Antarctica Tour
  Operators (IAATO), and does not include passengers on overflights
  and those flying directly in and out of Antarctica).

Spain
  Spain's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the
  world, and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and
  France. However, after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth,
  the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a
  recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in
  2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.4% in 2010,
  making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global
  recession. The reversal in Spain's economic growth reflects a
  significant decline in the construction sector, an oversupply of
  housing, falling consumer spending, and slumping exports. Government
  efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending, extended
  unemployment benefits, and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp
  rise in the unemployment rate, which rose from a low of about 8% in
  2007 to 20% in 2010. The government budget deficit worsened from
  3.8% of GDP in 2008 to about 9.7% of GDP in 2010, more than three
  times the euro-zone limit. Spain's large budget deficit and poor
  economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial
  contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the
  government's efforts to cut spending, privatize industries, and
  boost competitiveness through labor market reforms. Spanish banks'
  high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate
  market also poses a continued risk for the sector. The government
  intervened in one regional savings bank in 2009, and investors
  remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled
  banks. The Bank of Spain, however, is seeking to boost confidence in
  the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their
  losses and consolidate into stronger groups.

Spratly Islands
  Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing.
  The proximity to nearby oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins
  suggests the potential for oil and gas deposits, but the region is
  largely unexplored. There are no reliable estimates of potential
  reserves. Commercial exploitation has yet to be developed.

Sri Lanka
  Sri Lanka is engaging in large-scale reconstruction and
  development projects following the end of the 26-year conflict with
  the LTTE, including increasing electricity access and rebuilding its
  road and rail network. Additionally, Sri Lanka seeks to reduce
  poverty by using a combination of state directed policies and
  private investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas,
  develop small and medium enterprises, and promote increased
  agriculture, High levels of government funding may be difficult, as
  the government already is faced with high debt interest payments, a
  bloated civil service, and historically high budget deficits. The
  2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's
  economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments
  crisis, which was alleviated by a $2.6 billion IMF standby agreement
  in July 2009. The end of the civil war and the IMF loan, however,
  have largely restored investors' confidence, reflected in part by
  the Sri Lankan stock market's recognition as one of the best
  performing markets in the world. Sri Lankan growth rates averaged
  nearly 5% in during the war, but increased government spending on
  development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP
  growth to around 6-7% per year in 2006-08. After experiencing 3.5%
  growth in 2009, Sri Lanka's economy is poised to achieve high growth
  rates in the postwar period.

Sudan
  Since 1997, Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement
  macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate
  and a large reserve of foreign exchange. A new currency, the
  Sudanese Pound, was introduced in January 2007 at an initial
  exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds. Sudan began
  exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy
  boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices,
  and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the
  second half of 2008. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two
  decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure
  in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on
  subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at
  or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in
  average per capita income. Sudan's real GDP expanded by 5.2% during
  2010, an improvement over 2009's 4.2% growth but significantly below
  the more that 10% per year growth experienced prior to the global
  financial crisis in 2006 and 2007. While the oil sector continues to
  drive growth, services and utilities play an increasingly important
  role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important
  as it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP.
  In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession, scheduled in
  January 2011, Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the
  black market with the Central Bank's official rate also losing value
  as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency. The
  Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to
  defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced
  a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard
  currency, but uncertainty ahead of the referendum has meant that
  foreign exchange remained in heavy demand as 2010 came to a close.

Suriname
  The economy is dominated by the mining industry, with
  exports of alumina, gold, and oil accounting for about 85% of
  exports and 25% of government revenues, making the economy highly
  vulnerable to mineral price volatility. In 2000, the government of
  Ronald VENETIAAN, returned to office and inherited an economy with
  inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly
  implemented an austerity program, raised taxes, attempted to control
  spending, and tamed inflation. Economic growth reached about 6% in
  2007 and 2008, owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and
  oil. Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold
  mining sectors from Netherlands, Belgium, and the European
  Development Fund. The economy contracted in 2009, however, as
  investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity
  exports when global prices for most commodities fell. Trade picked
  up, boosting Suriname's economic growth in 2010, but the
  government's budget remained strained, with increased social
  spending during last year's election. Suriname's economic prospects
  for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to
  responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of
  structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.

Svalbard
  Coal mining, tourism, and international research are the
  major revenue sources on Svalbard. Coal mining is the dominant
  economic activity and a treaty of 9 February 1920 gave the 41
  signatories equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to
  Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal
  companies have mined in the past, the only companies still engaging
  in this are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are
  essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company
  employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs
  many of the local services, and provides most of the local
  infrastructure. There is also some hunting of seal, reindeer, and
  fox.

Swaziland
  In this small, landlocked economy, subsistence agriculture
  occupies approximately 70% of the population. The manufacturing
  sector has diversified since the mid-1980s. Sugar and wood pulp
  remain important foreign exchange earners. In 2007, the sugar
  industry increased efficiency and diversification efforts, in
  response to a 17% decline in EU sugar prices. Mining has declined in
  importance in recent years with only coal and quarry stone mines
  remaining active. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short
  border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South
  Africa from which it receives more than nine-tenths of its imports
  and to which it sends 60% of its exports. Swaziland's currency is
  pegged to the South African rand, subsuming Swaziland's monetary
  policy to South Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African
  Customs Union (SACU) account for two-thirds of Swaziland's
  government revenues, and worker remittances from South Africa
  substantially supplement domestically earned income. Customs
  revenues plummeted during the global economic crisis and Swaziland
  has appealed to SACU for assistance. With an estimated 40%
  unemployment rate, Swaziland's need to increase the number and size
  of small and medium enterprises and attract foreign direct
  investment is acute. Overgrazing, soil depletion, drought, and
  sometimes floods persist as problems for the future. More than
  one-fourth of the population needed emergency food aid in 2006-07
  because of drought, and more than one-quarter of the adult
  population has been infected by HIV/AIDS.

Sweden
  Aided by peace and neutrality for the whole of the 20th
  century, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
  mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits.
  It has a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
  communications, and a skilled labor force. In September 2003,
  Swedish voters turned down entry into the euro system concerned
  about the impact on the economy and sovereignty. Timber, hydropower,
  and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily
  oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
  about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering sector
  accounts for 50% of output and exports. Agriculture accounts for
  little more than 1% of GDP and of employment. Until 2008, Sweden was
  in the midst of a sustained economic upswing, boosted by increased
  domestic demand and strong exports. This and robust finances offered
  the center-right government considerable scope to implement its
  reform program aimed at increasing employment, reducing welfare
  dependence, and streamlining the state's role in the economy.
  Despite strong finances and underlying fundamentals, the Swedish
  economy slid into recession in the third quarter of 2008 and growth
  continued downward in 2009 as deteriorating global conditions
  reduced export demand and consumption. Strong exports of commodities
  and a return to profitability by Sweden's banking sector drove the
  strong rebound in 2010.

Switzerland
  Switzerland is a peaceful, prosperous, and modern market
  economy with low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a
  per capita GDP among the highest in the world. Switzerland's economy
  benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial
  services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in
  high-technology, knowledge-based production. The Swiss have brought
  their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's, in
  order to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade
  protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural
  sector. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn
  put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand
  stalled. The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively
  implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the
  economy and prevent appreciation of the franc. Switzerland's economy
  grew 2.8% in 2010, when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus
  program, but its prized banking sector has recently faced
  significant challenges. The country's largest banks suffered sizable
  losses in 2008-09, leading its largest bank to accept a government
  rescue deal in late 2008. Switzerland has also come under increasing
  pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and
  international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws.
  Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations
  on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion.
  The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with
  numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD
  standard, and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve
  outsanding issues, particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on
  bank deposits held by foreigners. Parliament passed the first five
  double-taxation agreements, including that with the US, in March
  2010, but the agreements are subject to public referendum. In 2009,
  Swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to
  reveal at Washington's behest the names of US account-holders
  suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud. These steps will
  have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy.

Syria
  Syrian economic growth slowed to 1.8% in 2009 as the global
  economic crisis affected oil prices and the economies of Syria's key
  export partners and sources of investment. Damascus has implemented
  modest economic reforms in the past few years, including cutting
  lending interest rates, opening private banks, consolidating all of
  the multiple exchange rates, raising prices on some subsidized
  items, most notably gasoline and cement, and establishing the
  Damascus Stock Exchange - which began operations in 2009. In
  addition, President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage
  corporate ownership reform, and to allow the Central Bank to issue
  Treasury bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless, the
  economy remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run
  economic constraints include declining oil production, high
  unemployment, rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on
  water supplies caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population
  growth, industrial expansion, and water pollution.

Taiwan
  Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with gradually
  decreasing government guidance of investment and foreign trade. In
  keeping with this trend, some large, state-owned banks and
  industrial firms have been privatized. Exports, led by electronics
  and machinery, generate about 70% of Taiwan's GDP growth, and have
  provided the primary impetus for economic development. This heavy
  dependence on exports makes the economy vulnerable to downturns in
  world demand. In 2009, Taiwan's GDP fell by 1.9%, due primarily to a
  20% year-on-year decline in exports. GDP grew more than 8% in 2010,
  as exports returned to the level of previous years. Taiwan's
  diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, and rapidly aging population
  are major long-term challenges. Free trade agreements have
  proliferated in East Asia over the past several years, but so far
  Taiwan has been excluded from this greater economic integration,
  largely for reasons of diplomacy. Taiwan's birth rate of only 1.2
  child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the
  prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and
  declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with
  the number of people over 65 accounting for 10.8% of the island's
  total population as of the end of 2009. The island runs a large
  trade surplus, and its foreign reserves are the world's fourth
  largest, behind China, Japan, and Russia. Since President MA
  Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, cross-Strait economic ties have
  increased significantly. Since 2005 China has overtaken the US to
  become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China
  is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct
  investment. Taipei has focused much of its economic recovery effort
  on improving cross-Strait economic integration. Three financial
  memorandums of understanding, covering banking, securities, and
  insurance, took effect in mid-January 2010, opening the island to
  greater investments from the Mainland's financial firms and
  institutional investors, and providing new opportunities for Taiwan
  financial firms to operate in China. Taiwan and the mainland in June
  2010 signed the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement
  (ECFA), an agreement similar to a free-trade agreement deal that
  will increase cross-Strait economic ties by lowering tariffs on a
  number of goods. Taiwan's goverment has said that the ECFA will
  serve as a stepping stone toward trade pacts with other regional
  partners and announced the beginning of negotiations on such an
  agreement with Singapore in August.

Tajikistan
  Tajikistan has one of the lowest per capita GDPs among
  the 15 former Soviet republics. Because of a lack of employment
  opportunities in Tajikistan, nearly half of the labor force works
  abroad, primarily in Russia and Kazakhstan, supporting families in
  Tajikistan through remittances. The exact number of labor migrants
  is unknown, but estimated at around 1 million. Less than 7% of the
  land area is arable. Cotton is the most important crop, but this
  sector is burdened with debt and obsolete infrastructure; moreover,
  government has encouraged a gradual transition away from cotton and
  towards food cultivation due to its concerns about feeding the
  population. Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and
  tungsten. Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant,
  hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light
  industry and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely
  damaged the already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp
  decline in industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's
  economic situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of
  structural reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power
  shortages, and the external debt burden. A debt restructuring
  agreement was reached with Russia in December 2002, including a $250
  million write-off of Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Completion of
  the Sangtuda I hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian
  investment - and the Sangtuda II and Rogun dams will add
  substantially to electricity output. If finished according to Tajik
  plans, Rogun will be the world's tallest dam. The World Bank, in
  2010, agreed to fund safety and feasibility studies for the Rogun
  Dam. Favorable reports from these studies could increase investor
  interest in the project, which has been stalled due to lack of
  funding. Tajikistan has also received substantial infrastructure
  development loans from the Chinese government to improve roads and
  an electricity transmission network. To help increase north-south
  trade, the US funded a $36 million bridge which opened in August
  2007 and links Tajikistan and Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has
  experienced steady economic growth since 1997, more than half of the
  population continues to live in poverty. Economic growth reached
  10.6% in 2004, but dropped below 8% in 2005-08, as the effects of
  higher oil prices and then the international financial crisis began
  to register - mainly in the form of lower prices for key export
  commodities and lower remittances from Tajiks working abroad, due to
  the global economic downturn. In 2009 GDP growth dropped to 3.4% as
  a result of the world recession.

Tanzania
  Tanzania is one of the world's poorest economies in terms
  of per capita income, however, Tanzania average 7% GDP growth per
  year between 2000 and 2008 on strong gold production and tourism.
  The economy depends heavily on agriculture, which accounts for more
  than one-fourth of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs about
  60% of the work force. The World Bank, the IMF, and bilateral donors
  have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's aging economic
  infrastructure, including rail and port infrastructure that are
  important trade links for inland countries. Recent banking reforms
  have helped increase private-sector growth and investment, and the
  government has increased spending on agriculture to 7% of its
  budget. Continued donor assistance and solid macroeconomic policies
  supported a positive growth rate, despite the world recession. In
  2008, Tanzania received the world's largest Millennium Challenge
  Compact grant, worth $698 million. Dar es Salaam used fiscal
  stimulus and loosened monitary policy to ease the impact of the
  global recession. GDP growth in 2009-10 was a respectable 6% per
  year due to high gold prices and increased production.

Thailand
  With a well-developed infrastructure, a free-enterprise
  economy, generally pro-investment policies, and strong export
  industries, Thailand enjoyed solid growth from 2000 to 2008 -
  averaging more than 4% per year - as it recovered from the Asian
  financial crisis of 1997-98. Thai exports - mostly machinery and
  electronic components, agricultural commodities, and jewelry -
  continue to drive the economy, accounting for more than half of GDP.
  The global financial crisis of 2008-09 severely cut Thailand's
  exports, with most sectors experiencing double-digit drops. In 2009,
  the economy contracted 2.2%. In 2010, Thailand's economy expanded
  7.6%, its fastest pace since 1995, as exports rebounded from their
  depressed 2009 level. Antigovernment protests during March-May and
  the country's polarized political situation had - at most - a
  temporary impact on business and consumer confidence. Although
  tourism was hit hard during the protests, its quick recovery helped
  boost consumer confidence to new highs. Moreover, business and
  investor sentiment remained buoyant as Thailand's stock market grew
  almost 5% during the three-month period. The economy probably will
  continue to experience high grow well into 2011.

Timor-Leste
  In late 1999, about 70% of the economic infrastructure
  of Timor-Leste was laid waste by Indonesian troops and
  anti-independence militias. Three hundred thousand people fled
  westward. Over the next three years a massive international program,
  manned by 5,000 peacekeepers (8,000 at peak) and 1,300 police
  officers, led to substantial reconstruction in both urban and rural
  areas. By the end of 2005, refugees had returned or had settled in
  Indonesia. The country continues to face great challenges in
  rebuilding its infrastructure, strengthening the civil
  administration, and generating jobs for young people entering the
  work force. The development of oil and gas resources in offshore
  waters has greatly supplemented government revenues. This
  technology-intensive industry, however, has done little to create
  jobs for the unemployed because there are no production facilities
  in Timor. Gas is piped to Australia. In June 2005, the National
  Parliament unanimously approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to
  serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and to preserve the
  value of Timor-Leste's petroleum wealth for future generations. The
  Fund held assets of US$5.3 billion as of October 2009. The economy
  has been little impacted by the global financial crisis and
  continues to recover strongly from the mid-2006 outbreak of violence
  and civil unrest, which disrupted both private and public sector
  economic activity. The government in 2008 resettled tens of
  thousands of an estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons
  (IDPs); most IDPs returned home by early 2009. The underlying
  economic policy challenge the country faces remains how best to use
  oil-and-gas wealth to lift the non-oil economy onto a higher growth
  path and to reduce poverty.

Togo
  This small, sub-Saharan economy suffers from anemic economic
  growth and depends heavily on both commercial and subsistence
  agriculture, which provides employment for 65% of the labor force.
  Some basic foodstuffs must still be imported. Cocoa, coffee, and
  cotton generate about 40% of export earnings with cotton being the
  most important cash crop. Togo is the world's fourth-largest
  producer of phosphate. The government's decade-long effort,
  supported by the World Bank and the IMF, to implement economic
  reform measures, encourage foreign investment, and bring revenues in
  line with expenditures has moved slowly. Progress depends on follow
  through on privatization, increased openness in government financial
  operations, progress toward legislative elections, and continued
  support from foreign donors. Togo is on track with its IMF Extended
  Credit Facility and reached a HIPC debt relief completion point in
  2010 at which 95% of the country's debt was forgiven. Economic
  growth prospects remain marginal due to declining cotton production
  and underinvestment in phosphate mining.

Tokelau
  Tokelau's small size (three villages), isolation, and lack
  of resources greatly restrain economic development and confine
  agriculture to the subsistence level. The people rely heavily on aid
  from New Zealand - about $10 million annually in 2008 and 2009 - to
  maintain public services. New Zealand's support amounts to 80% of
  Tokelau's recurrent government budget. An international trust fund,
  currently worth nearly US$32 million, was established in 2004 to
  provide Tokelau an independent source of revenue. The principal
  sources of revenue come from sales of copra, postage stamps,
  souvenir coins, and handicrafts. Money is also remitted to families
  from relatives in New Zealand.

Tonga
  Tonga has a small, open, South Pacific island economy. It has
  a narrow export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans,
  and yams are the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish,
  make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high
  proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains
  dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongan communities
  overseas to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest
  source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had
  39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the
  development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of
  investment, and is committing increased funds for health and
  education. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and
  well developed social services. High unemployment among the young, a
  continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and
  rising civil service expenditures are major issues facing the
  government.

Trinidad and Tobago
  Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as
  an excellent investment site for international businesses and has
  one of the highest growth rates and per capita incomes in Latin
  America. Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly
  over 8%, significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for
  that same period; however, GDP has slowed down since then and
  contracted about 3.5% in 2009, before rising more than 2% in 2010.
  Growth has been fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas
  (LNG), petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical,
  aluminum, and plastics projects are in various stages of planning.
  Trinidad and Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and
  gas, and its economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but
  it also supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and
  beverages, as well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas
  account for about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of
  employment. The country is also a regional financial center, and
  tourism is a growing sector, although it is not as important
  domestically as it is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy
  benefits from a growing trade surplus. The previous MANNING
  administration benefited from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic
  export sector; however, declines in oil and gas prices have reduced
  government revenues which will challenge the new government's
  commitment to maintaining high levels of public investment.

Tunisia
  Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural,
  mining, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Governmental control of
  economic affairs while still heavy has gradually lessened over the
  past decade with increasing privatization, simplification of the tax
  structure, and a prudent approach to debt. Progressive social
  policies also have helped raise living conditions in Tunisia
  relative to the region. Real growth, which averaged almost 5% over
  the past decade, declined to 4.6% in 2008 and to 3-4% in 2009-10
  because of economic contraction and slowing of import demand in
  Europe - Tunisia's largest export market. However, development of
  non-textile manufacturing, a recovery in agricultural production,
  and strong growth in the services sector somewhat mitigated the
  economic effect of slowing exports. Tunisia will need to reach even
  higher growth levels to create sufficient employment opportunities
  for an already large number of unemployed as well as the growing
  population of university graduates. The challenges ahead include:
  privatizing industry, liberalizing the investment code to increase
  foreign investment, improving government efficiency, reducing the
  trade deficit, and reducing socioeconomic disparities in the
  impoverished south and west.

Turkey
  Turkey's economy is increasingly driven by its industry and
  service sectors, although its traditional agriculture sector still
  accounts for about 30% of employment. An aggressive privatization
  program has reduced state involvement in basic industry, banking,
  transport, and communication, and an emerging cadre of middle-class
  entrepreneurs is adding a dynamism to the economy. Turkey's
  traditional textiles and clothing clothing sectors still account for
  one-third of industrial employment, despite stiff competition in
  international markets that resulted from the end of the global quota
  system. Other sectors, notably the automotive, construction, and
  electronics industries, are rising in importance and have surpassed
  textiles within Turkey's export mix. Oil began to flow through the
  Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline in May 2006, marking a major milestone
  that will bring up to 1 million barrels per day from the Caspian to
  market. Several gas pipelines also are being planned to help move
  Central Asian gas to Europe via Turkey, which will help address
  Turkey's dependence on energy imports over the long term. After
  Turkey experienced a severe financial crisis in 2001, Ankara adopted
  financial and fiscal reforms as part of an IMF program. The reforms
  strengthened the country's economic fundamentals and ushered in an
  era of strong growth - averaging more than 6% annually until 2009,
  when global economic conditions and tighter fiscal policy slowed
  growth to 4.7%, reduced inflation to 6.5% - a 34-year low - and cut
  the public sector debt-to-GPD ratio below 50%. Turkey's
  well-regulated financial markets and banking system weathered the
  global financial crisis and GDP rebounded strongly to 7.3% in 2010,
  as exports returned to normal levels following the recession. The
  economy, however, continues to be burdened by a high current account
  deficit and remains dependent on often volatile, short-term
  investment to finance its trade deficit. The stock value of FDI
  stood at $174 billion at year-end 2010, but inflows have slowed
  considerably in light of continuing economic turmoil in Europe, the
  source of much of Turkey's FDI. Further economic and judicial
  reforms and prospective EU membership are expected to boost Turkey's
  attractiveness to foreign investors. However, Turkey's relatively
  high current account deficit, uncertainty related to policy-making,
  and fiscal imbalances leave the economy vulnerable to destabilizing
  shifts in investor confidence.

Turkmenistan
  Turkmenistan is largely a desert country with intensive
  agriculture in irrigated oases and sizeable gas and oil resources.
  The two largest crops are cotton, most of which is produced for
  export, and wheat, which is domestically consumed. Although
  agriculture accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, it continues to employ
  nearly half of the country's workforce. With an authoritarian
  ex-Communist regime in power and a tribally based social structure,
  Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform,
  hoping to use gas and cotton export revenues to sustain its
  inefficient economy. Privatization goals remain limited. From
  1998-2005, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate
  export routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive
  short-term external debt. At the same time, however, total exports
  rose by an average of roughly 15% per year from 2003-08, largely
  because of higher international oil and gas prices. New pipelines to
  China and Iran, that began operation in late 2009 and early 2010,
  have given Turkmenistan additional export routes for its gas,
  although these new routes have not offset the sharp drop in export
  revenue since early 2009 from decreased gas exports to Russia.
  Overall prospects in the near future are discouraging because of
  widespread internal poverty, endemic corruption, a poor educational
  system, government misuse of oil and gas revenues, and Ashgabat's
  reluctance to adopt market-oriented reforms. In the past,
  Turkmenistan's economic statistics were state secrets. The new
  government has established a State Agency for Statistics, but GDP
  numbers and other figures are subject to wide margins of error. In
  particular, the rate of GDP growth is uncertain. Since his election,
  President BERDIMUHAMEDOW unified the country's dual currency
  exchange rate, ordered the redenomination of the manat, reduced
  state subsidies for gasoline, and initiated development of a special
  tourism zone on the Caspian Sea. Although foreign investment is
  encouraged, numerous bureaucratic obstacles impede international
  business activity.

Turks and Caicos Islands
  The Turks and Caicos economy is based on
  tourism, offshore financial services, and fishing. Most capital
  goods and food for domestic consumption are imported. The US is the
  leading source of tourists, accounting for more than three-quarters
  of the 175,000 visitors that arrived in 2004. Major sources of
  government revenue also include fees from offshore financial
  activities and customs receipts.

Tuvalu
  Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of
  nine coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known mineral
  resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon
  imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the
  primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average,
  visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public
  sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the
  adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and
  remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2
  million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the
  Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in
  1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and
  South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative
  withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an
  estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly
  $9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important
  cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US
  Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of
  payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure
  financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing
  public sector reforms, including privatization of some government
  functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the
  lease of its ".tv" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2
  million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the
  sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction
  of merchandise imports, continued reliance must be placed on fishing
  and telecommunications license fees, remittances from overseas
  workers, official transfers, and income from overseas investments.
  Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to
  climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation.

Uganda
  Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
  soils, regular rainfall, small deposits of copper, gold, and other
  minerals, and recently discovered oil. Uganda has never conducted a
  national minerals survey. Agriculture is the most important sector
  of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee
  accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986, the government
  - with the support of foreign countries and international agencies -
  has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
  currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
  prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The
  policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and
  boosting production and export earnings. Since 1990 economic reforms
  ushered in an era of solid economic growth based on continued
  investment in infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
  exports, lower inflation, better domestic security, and the return
  of exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs. Uganda has received about $2
  billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief. In 2007 Uganda
  received $10 million for a Millennium Challenge Account Threshold
  Program. The global economic downturn has hurt Uganda's exports;
  however, Uganda's GDP growth is still relatively strong due to past
  reforms and sound management of the downturn. Oil revenues and taxes
  will become a larger source of government funding as oil comes on
  line in the next few years. Instability in southern Sudan is the
  biggest risk for the Ugandan economy in 2011 because Uganda's main
  export partner is Sudan and Uganda is a key destination for Sudanese
  refugees.

Ukraine
  After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the
  most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
  producing about four times the output of the next-ranking republic.
  Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of Soviet
  agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
  of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics. Likewise,
  its diversified heavy industry supplied the unique equipment (for
  example, large diameter pipes) and raw materials to industrial and
  mining sites (vertical drilling apparatus) in other regions of the
  former USSR. Shortly after independence in August 1991, the
  Ukrainian Government liberalized most prices and erected a legal
  framework for privatization, but widespread resistance to reform
  within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform
  efforts and led to some backtracking. Output by 1999 had fallen to
  less than 40% of the 1991 level. Ukraine's dependence on Russia for
  energy supplies and the lack of significant structural reform have
  made the Ukrainian economy vulnerable to external shocks. Ukraine
  depends on imports to meet about three-fourths of its annual oil and
  natural gas requirements and 100% of its nuclear fuel needs. After a
  two-week dispute that saw gas supplies cutoff to Europe, Ukraine
  agreed to ten-year gas supply and transit contracts with Russia in
  January 2009 that brought gas prices to "world" levels. The strict
  terms of the contracts have further hobbled Ukraine's cash-strapped
  state gas company, Naftohaz. Outside institutions - particularly the
  IMF - have encouraged Ukraine to quicken the pace and scope of
  reforms. Ukrainian Government officials eliminated most tax and
  customs privileges in a March 2005 budget law, bringing more
  economic activity out of Ukraine's large shadow economy, but more
  improvements are needed, including fighting corruption, developing
  capital markets, and improving the legislative framework. Ukraine's
  economy was buoyant despite political turmoil between the prime
  minister and president until mid-2008. Real GDP growth exceeded 7%
  in 2006-07, fueled by high global prices for steel - Ukraine's top
  export - and by strong domestic consumption, spurred by rising
  pensions and wages. Ukraine reached an agreement with the IMF for a
  $16.4 billion Stand-By Arrangement in November 2008 to deal with the
  economic crisis, but the Ukrainian Government's lack of progress in
  implementing reforms has twice delayed the release of IMF assistance
  funds. The drop in steel prices and Ukraine's exposure to the global
  financial crisis due to aggressive foreign borrowing lowered growth
  in 2008 and the economy contracted more than 15% in 2009, among the
  worst economic performances in the world; growth resumed in 2010,
  buoyed by exports. External conditions are likely to hamper efforts
  for economic recovery in 2011.

United Arab Emirates
  The UAE has an open economy with a high per
  capita income and a sizable annual trade surplus. Successful efforts
  at economic diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on
  oil and gas output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE
  more than 30 years ago, the UAE has undergone a profound
  transformation from an impoverished region of small desert
  principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. The
  government has increased spending on job creation and infrastructure
  expansion and is opening up utilities to greater private sector
  involvement. In April 2004, the UAE signed a Trade and Investment
  Framework Agreement with Washington and in November 2004 agreed to
  undertake negotiations toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US,
  however, those talks have not moved forward. The country's Free
  Trade Zones - offering 100% foreign ownership and zero taxes - are
  helping to attract foreign investors. The global financial crisis,
  tight international credit, and deflated asset prices slowed GDP
  growth in 2010. UAE authorities tried to blunt the crisis by
  increasing spending and boosting liquidity in the banking sector.
  The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it was heavily exposed to depressed
  real estate prices. Dubai lacked sufficient cash to meet its debt
  obligations, prompting global concern about its solvency. The UAE
  Central Bank and Abu Dhabi-based banks bought the largest shares. In
  December 2009 Dubai received an additional $10 billion loan from the
  emirate of Abu Dhabi. The economy is expected to continue a slow
  rebound. Dependence on oil, a large expatriate workforce, and
  growing inflation pressures are significant long-term challenges.
  The UAE's strategic plan for the next few years focuses on
  diversification and creating more opportunities for nationals
  through improved education and increased private sector employment.

United Kingdom
  The UK, a leading trading power and financial center,
  is the third largest economy in Europe after Germany and France.
  Over the past two decades, the government has greatly reduced public
  ownership and contained the growth of social welfare programs.
  Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by
  European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with less than
  2% of the labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil
  resources, but its oil and natural gas reserves are declining and
  the UK became a net importer of energy in 2005. Services,
  particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by
  far for the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to
  decline in importance. After emerging from recession in 1992,
  Britain's economy enjoyed the longest period of expansion on record
  during which time growth outpaced most of Western Europe. In 2008,
  however, the global financial crisis hit the economy particularly
  hard, due to the importance of its financial sector. Sharply
  declining home prices, high consumer debt, and the global economic
  slowdown compounded Britain's economic problems, pushing the economy
  into recession in the latter half of 2008 and prompting the then
  BROWN government to implement a number of measures to stimulate the
  economy and stabilize the financial markets; these include
  nationalizing parts of the banking system, cutting taxes, suspending
  public sector borrowing rules, and moving forward public spending on
  capital projects. Facing burgeoning public deficits and debt levels,
  the CAMERON government in 2010 initiiated a five-year austerity
  program, which aims to lower London's budget deficit from over 11%
  of GDP in 2010 to nearly 1% by 2015. The Bank of England
  periodically coordinates interest rate moves with the European
  Central Bank, but Britain remains outside the European Economic and
  Monetary Union (EMU).

United States
  The US has the largest and most technologically
  powerful economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $47,400. In
  this market-oriented economy, private individuals and business firms
  make most of the decisions, and the federal and state governments
  buy needed goods and services predominantly in the private
  marketplace. US business firms enjoy greater flexibility than their
  counterparts in Western Europe and Japan in decisions to expand
  capital plant, to lay off surplus workers, and to develop new
  products. At the same time, they face higher barriers to enter their
  rivals' home markets than foreign firms face entering US markets. US
  firms are at or near the forefront in technological advances,
  especially in computers and in medical, aerospace, and military
  equipment; their advantage has narrowed since the end of World War
  II. The onrush of technology largely explains the gradual
  development of a "two-tier labor market" in which those at the
  bottom lack the education and the professional/technical skills of
  those at the top and, more and more, fail to get comparable pay
  raises, health insurance coverage, and other benefits. Since 1975,
  practically all the gains in household income have gone to the top
  20% of households. The war in March-April 2003 between a US-led
  coalition and Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraq, required
  major shifts in national resources to the military. Soaring oil
  prices between 2005 and the first half of 2008 threatened inflation
  and unemployment, as higher gasoline prices ate into consumers'
  budgets. Imported oil accounts for about 60% of US consumption.
  Long-term problems include inadequate investment in economic
  infrastructure, rapidly rising medical and pension costs of an aging
  population, sizable trade and budget deficits, and stagnation of
  family income in the lower economic groups. The merchandise trade
  deficit reached a record $840 billion in 2008 before shrinking to
  $506 billion in 2009, and ramping back up to $630 billion in 2010.
  The global economic downturn, the sub-prime mortgage crisis,
  investment bank failures, falling home prices, and tight credit
  pushed the United States into a recession by mid-2008. GDP
  contracted until the third quarter of 2009, making this the deepest
  and longest downturn since the Great Depression. To help stabilize
  financial markets, the US Congress established a $700 billion
  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) in October 2008. The government
  used some of these funds to purchase equity in US banks and other
  industrial corporations, much of which had been returned to the
  government by early 2011. In January 2009 the US Congress passed and
  President Barack OBAMA signed a bill providing an additional $787
  billion fiscal stimulus to be used over 10 years - two-thirds on
  additional spending and one-third on tax cuts - to create jobs and
  to help the economy recover. Approximately two-thirds of these funds
  were injected into the economy by the end of 2010. In March 2010,
  President OBAMA signed a health insurance reform bill into law that
  will extend coverage to an additional 32 million American citizens
  by 2016, through private health insurance for the general population
  and Medicaid for the impoverished. In July 2010, the president
  signed the DODD-FRANK Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
  Act, a bill designed to promote financial stability by protecting
  consumers from financial abuses, ending taxpayer bailouts of
  financial firms, dealing with troubled banks that are "too big to
  fail," and improving accountability and transparency in the
  financial system - in particular, by requiring certain financial
  derivatives to be traded in markets that are subject to government
  regulation and oversight. In late 2010, the US Federal Reserve Bank
  (The Fed) announced that it would purchase $600 billion worth of US
  Government bonds by June 2011, in an attempt to keep interest rates
  from rising and snuffing out the nascent recovery.

Uruguay
  Uruguay's economy is characterized by an export-oriented
  agricultural sector, a well-educated work force, and high levels of
  social spending. After averaging growth of 5% annually during
  1996-98, in 1999-2002 the economy suffered a major downturn,
  stemming largely from the spillover effects of the economic problems
  of its large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. In 2001-02, Argentine
  citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited in Uruguayan
  banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen, which led to a
  plunge in the Uruguayan peso, a banking crisis, and a sharp economic
  contraction. Real GDP fell in four years by nearly 20%, with 2002
  the worst year. The unemployment rate rose, inflation surged, and
  the burden of external debt doubled. Financial assistance from the
  IMF helped stem the damage. Uruguay restructured its external debt
  in 2003 without asking creditors to accept a reduction on the
  principal. Economic growth for Uruguay resumed, and averaged 8%
  annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial
  crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated
  to 2.9% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a
  recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher
  public expenditure and investment, and GDP growth exceeded 7% in
  2010.

Uzbekistan
  Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country; 11% of the land
  is intensely cultivated, in irrigated river valleys. More than 60%
  of the population lives in densely populated rural communities.
  Export of hydrocarbons, including natural gas and petroleum,
  provided about 40% of foreign exchange earnings in 2009. Other major
  export earners include gold and cotton. Uzbekistan is now the
  world's second-largest cotton exporter and fifth largest producer;
  it has come under increasing international criticism for the use of
  child labor in its annual cotton harvest. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan
  enjoyed a bumper cotton crop in 2010 amidst record high prices.
  Following independence in September 1991, the government sought to
  prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight
  controls on production and prices. While aware of the need to
  improve the investment climate, the government still sponsors
  measures that often increase, not decrease, its control over
  business decisions. A sharp increase in the inequality of income
  distribution has hurt the lower ranks of society since independence.
  In 2003, the government accepted Article VIII obligations under the
  IMF, providing for full currency convertibility. However, strict
  currency controls and tightening of borders have lessened the
  effects of convertibility and have also led to some shortages that
  have further stifled economic activity. The Central Bank often
  delays or restricts convertibility, especially for consumer goods.
  Potential investment by Russia and China in Uzbekistan's gas and oil
  industry, as well as increased cooperation with South Korea in the
  realm of civil aviation, may boost growth prospects. However,
  decreased demand for natural gas in Europe and Russia in the wake of
  the global financial crisis could reduce energy-related revenues in
  the near term. In November 2005, Russian President Vladimir PUTIN
  and Uzbekistan President KARIMOV signed an "alliance," which
  included provisions for economic and business cooperation. Russian
  businesses have shown increased interest in Uzbekistan, especially
  in mining, telecom, and oil and gas. In 2006, Uzbekistan took steps
  to rejoin the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and the
  Eurasian Economic Community (EurASEC), which it subsequently left in
  2008, both organizations dominated by Russia. In the past Uzbek
  authorities had accused US and other foreign companies operating in
  Uzbekistan of violating Uzbek tax laws and have frozen their assets,
  but no new expropriations occurred in 2008-09. Instead, the Uzbek
  Government has actively courted several major U.S. and international
  corporations, offering attractive financing and tax advantages, and
  has landed a significant US investment in the automotive industry.
  Although growth slowed in 2009-10, Uzbekistan has seen few other
  effects from the global economic downturn, primarily due to its
  relative isolation from the global financial markets.

Vanuatu
  This South Pacific island economy is based primarily on
  small-scale agriculture, which provides a living for about
  two-thirds of the population. Fishing, offshore financial services,
  and tourism, with nearly 197,000 visitors in 2008, are other
  mainstays of the economy. Mineral deposits are negligible; the
  country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light industry
  sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from
  import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on
  relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural
  disasters, and long distances from main markets and between
  constituent islands. In response to foreign concerns, the government
  has promised to tighten regulation of its offshore financial center.
  In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism
  through improved air connections, resort development, and cruise
  ship facilities. Agriculture, especially livestock farming, is a
  second target for growth. Australia and New Zealand are the main
  suppliers of tourists and foreign aid.

Venezuela
  Venezuela remains highly dependent on oil revenues, which
  account for roughly 95% of export earnings, about 55% of the federal
  budget revenues, and around 30% of GDP. A nationwide strike between
  December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic
  consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003
  - but economic output since then has recovered strongly. Fueled by
  high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP by
  about 10% in 2006, 8% in 2007, and nearly 5% in 2008, before a sharp
  drop in oil prices caused a contraction in 2009-10. This spending,
  combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to
  domestic credit, has created a consumption boom but has come at the
  cost of higher inflation - roughly 32% in 2008, and slowing only
  slightly to 30% in 2010, despite the lengthy downturn. Imports also
  jumped significantly before the recession of 2009. President Hugo
  CHAVEZ's continued efforts to increase the government's control of
  the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial,
  construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private
  investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed
  non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the
  prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric
  power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's
  electricity - nearly shut down. In January, 2010, CHAVEZ announced a
  dual exchange rate system for the bolivar and closed the unofficial
  foreign exchange market - the "parallel" market - in an effort to
  stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. The foreign
  exchange system offers a 2.6 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of
  essentials, including food, medicine, and industrial machinery, and
  a 4.3 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of other products,
  including cars and telephones.

Vietnam
  Vietnam is a densely-populated developing country that in
  the last 30 years has had to recover from the ravages of war, the
  loss of financial support from the old Soviet Bloc, and the
  rigidities of a centrally-planned economy. Vietnamese authorities
  have reaffirmed their commitment to economic liberalization and
  international integration. They have moved to implement the
  structural reforms needed to modernize the economy and to produce
  more competitive export-driven industries. Vietnam joined the WTO in
  January 2007 following more than a decade-long negotiation process.
  WTO membership has provided Vietnam an anchor to the global market
  and reinforced the domestic economic reform process. Agriculture's
  share of economic output has continued to shrink from about 25% in
  2000 to about 21% in 2009. Deep poverty has declined significantly
  and Vietnam is working to create jobs to meet the challenge of a
  labor force that is growing by more than one million people every
  year. The global recession has hurt Vietnam's export-oriented
  economy with GDP growing less than the 7% per annum average achieved
  during the last decade. In 2009 exports fell nearly 10%
  year-on-year, prompting the government to consider adjustments to
  tariffs to limit the trade deficit. The government has used stimulus
  spending, including a subsidized lending program, to help the
  economy through the global financial crisis. Vietnam's managed
  currency, the dong, faced downward pressure during the recession and
  the government devalued it by nearly 7% in December 2009. Foreign
  donors pledged $8 billion in new development assistance for 2010.
  Export growth resumed in 2010, driving GDP upward. However, Hanoi
  has struggled to control one of the region's highest inflation
  rates, which stands at 11.1% with interest hikes and multiple
  devaluations of the dong. Vietnam's economy faces higher lending
  rates, additional IMF scrutiny, domestic inflationary pressures, and
  an underperforming stock market.

Virgin Islands
  Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting
  for 80% of GDP and employment. The islands hosted 2.4 million
  visitors in 2008. The manufacturing sector consists of petroleum
  refining, rum distilling, textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals,
  and watch assembly. One of the world's largest petroleum refineries
  is at Saint Croix. The agricultural sector is small, with most food
  being imported. International business and financial services are
  small but growing components of the economy. The islands are
  vulnerable to substantial damage from storms. The government is
  working to improve fiscal discipline, to support construction
  projects in the private sector, to expand tourist facilities, to
  reduce crime, and to protect the environment.

Wake Island
  Economic activity is limited to providing services to
  military personnel and contractors located on the island. All food
  and manufactured goods must be imported.

Wallis and Futuna
  The economy is limited to traditional subsistence
  agriculture, with about 80% of labor force earnings from agriculture
  (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing.
  About 4% of the population is employed in government. Revenues come
  from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to
  Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from expatriate
  workers in New Caledonia.

West Bank
  The West Bank - the larger of the two areas comprising the
  Palestinian territories - experienced a high single-digit economic
  growth rate in 2010 as a result of inflows of donor aid, the
  Palestinian Authority's (PA) implementation of economic and security
  reforms, and the easing of some movement and access restrictions by
  the Israeli Government. Nevertheless, overall standard-of-living
  measures remain near levels seen prior to the start of the second
  intifada in 2000. The almost decade-long downturn largely has been a
  result of Israeli closure policies - a steady increase in movement
  and access restrictions across the West Bank in response to Israeli
  security concerns which have disrupted labor and trade flows,
  industrial capacity, and basic commerce, both external and internal.
  Since 2008, the PA under President Mahmoud ABBAS and Prime Minister
  Salam FAYYAD has implemented a largely successful campaign of
  institutional reforms that has contributed to increased security and
  economic performance, supported by more than $3 billion in direct
  foreign donor assistance to the PA's budget since 2007. An easing of
  some Israeli restrictions on West Bank movement and access since
  2008 also has contributed to an uptick in retail activity in larger
  cities. The biggest impediments to economic improvements in the West
  Bank remain Palestinians' lack of access to land and resources in
  Israeli-controlled areas, import and export restrictions, and a
  high-cost capital structure. Absent robust private sector growth,
  the PA will continue to rely heavily on donor aid for its budgetary
  needs.

Western Sahara
  Western Sahara has a small market-based economy whose
  main indutries are fishing, phosphate mining, and pastoral nomadism.
  The territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture
  difficult, and Wstern Sahara imports much of its food. The Moroccan
  Government administers Western Sahara's economy and is a source of
  employment, infrstructure development, and social spending in the
  territory. Western Sahara's unresolved legal status makes the
  exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between
  Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a
  four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast
  of Morocco, including the disputed waters off the coast of Western
  Sahara. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially
  significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled
  over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration
  in the territory. Western Sahara's main long-term economic challenge
  is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of
  providing greater employment and income to the territory.

World
  In 2010, world output - and per capita income - began to
  recover from the 2008-09 recession, the first global downturn since
  1946. Gross World Product (GWP) grew 4.6%, largely on the strength
  of rebounding exports, which rose about 20% from the level of 2009.
  Growth was not evenly distributed across countries, however. Lower
  income countries - those with per capita incomes below $30,000 per
  year - averaged 6.3% growth, while higher income countries - with
  per capita incomes above $30,000 - averaged just 2.8% growth. And
  countries with current account surpluses averaged 6.0% growth, while
  those with current account deficits averaged just 3.4% growth. Among
  large economies, China (+10.1%), Taiwan (+8.3%), India (+8.3%),
  Brazil (+7.5%), and South Korea (+6.1%) recorded the biggest GDP
  gains - China also became the world's largest exporter. Continuing
  uncertainties in mortgage and financial markets resulted in slower
  growth in Japan (+3.0%), the US (+2.8%), and the European Union
  (+1.7%). In 2010, global unemployment continued to creep upwards,
  reaching 8.8% - underemployment, especially in the developing world,
  remained much higher. Global gross fixed investment stabilized at
  about 23% of GWP, after a significant drop in 2009. World trade
  appears to be returning to pre-2009 patterns, with current account
  surpluses or deficits rising for a majority of countries. World
  external debt, however, dropped again in 2010 - about 5% from the
  2009 level, as many countries reduced borrowing. Many, if not most,
  countries pursued expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. The
  global money supply, both narrowly and broadly defined, increased
  roughly 10%, as countries tried to keep interest rates low; the
  global budget deficit stablilized at roughly $3.5 trillion, as
  countries tried to rein in spending and slow the rise of public debt.
  The international financial crisis of 2008-09 presents the world
  economy with a major new challenge, together with several
  long-standing ones. The fiscal stimulus packages put in place in
  2009-10 required most countries to run budget deficits - government
  balances have deteriorated for 14 out of every 15 countries.
  Treasuries issued new public debt - totaling $5.5 trillion since
  2008 - to pay for the additional expenditures. To keep interest
  rates low, many central banks monetized that debt, injecting large
  sums of money into the economies. As economic activity picks up,
  central banks will face the difficult task of containing inflation
  without raising interest rates so high they snuff out further
  growth. At the same time, governments will face the difficult task
  of spurring current growth and employment without saddling their
  economies with so much debt that they sacrifice long-term growth and
  financial stability.
  Long-standing challenges the world faces are several. The addition
  of 80 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe is
  exacerbating the problems of underemployment, pollution,
  waste-disposal, epidemics, water-shortages, famine, over-fishing of
  oceans, deforestation, desertification, and depletion of
  non-renewable resources. The nation-state, as a bedrock
  economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
  international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
  Internally, central governments often find their control over
  resources slipping as separatist regional movements - typically
  based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in many of the successor
  states of the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, in
  India, in Iraq, in Indonesia, and in Canada. Externally, central
  governments are losing decisionmaking powers to international
  bodies, most notably the EU. The introduction of the euro as the
  common currency of much of Western Europe in January 1999, while
  paving the way for an integrated economic powerhouse, poses economic
  risks because the participating nations are culturally and
  politically diverse and have varying levels and rates of growth of
  income, and hence, differing needs for monetary and fiscal policies.
  In Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem
  of channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to
  increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment.
  Because of their own internal problems and priorities, the
  industrialized countries devote insufficient resources to deal
  effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least from
  an economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. The
  terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 accentuated a
  growing risk to global prosperity, illustrated, for example, by the
  reallocation of resources away from investment to anti-terrorist
  programs. Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan added new uncertainties to
  global economic prospects.
  Despite these challenges, the world economy also shows great
  promise. Technology has made possible further advances in all
  fields, from agriculture, to medicine, alternative energy,
  metallurgy, and transportation. Improved global communications have
  greatly reduced the costs of international trade, helping the world
  gain from the international division of labor, raise living
  standards, and reduce income disparities among nations. Much of the
  resilience of the world economy in the aftermath of the financial
  crisis resulted from government leaders around the globe working in
  concert to stem the financial onslaught, knowing well the lessons of
  past economic failures.

Yemen
  Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on
  declining oil resources for revenue. Petroleum accounts for roughly
  25% of GDP and 70% of government revenue. Yemen has tried to counter
  the effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its
  economy through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is
  designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign
  investment. In October 2009, Yemen exported its first liquefied
  natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In January 2010,
  the international community established the Friends of Yemen group
  that aims to support Yemen's efforts towards economic and political
  reform, and in August 2010 the IMF approved a three-year $370
  million program to further this effort. Despite these ambitious
  endeavors, Yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges,
  including declining water resources and a high population growth
  rate.

Zambia
  Zambia's economy has experienced strong growth in recent
  years, with real GDP growth in 2005-08 about 6% per year.
  Privatization of government-owned copper mines in the 1990s relieved
  the government from covering mammoth losses generated by the
  industry and greatly improved the chances for copper mining to
  return to profitability and spur economic growth. Copper output has
  increased steadily since 2004, due to higher copper prices and
  foreign investment. In 2005, Zambia qualified for debt relief under
  the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative, consisting of
  approximately USD 6 billion in debt relief. Poverty remains a
  significant problem in Zambia, despite a stronger economy. Declining
  world commodity prices and demand slowed GDP growth in 2008, but a
  sharp rebound in copper prices and a bumper maize crop helped Zambia
  recover. Lack of economic diversity subjects Zambia to fluctuations
  in copper prices and in the weather.

Zimbabwe
  The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of
  difficult economic problems. Its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in
  the Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of
  dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program,
  characterized by chaos and violence, has badly damaged the
  commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and
  foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe
  into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food
  aid on humanitarian grounds. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of
  Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing
  hyperinflation. The power-sharing government formed in February 2009
  has led to some economic improvements, including the cessation of
  hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and
  removing price controls. The economy is registering its first growth
  in a decade, but will be reliant on further political improvement
  for greater growth.
