  Flag description

Afghanistan
  three equal vertical bands of black (hoist side), red,
  and green, with the national emblem in white centered on the red
  band and slightly overlapping the other two bands; the center of the
  emblem features a mosque with pulpit and flags on either side, below
  the mosque are numerals for the solar year 1298 (1919 in the
  Gregorian calendar, the year of Afghan independence from the UK);
  this central image is circled by a border consisting of sheaves of
  wheat on the left and right, in the upper-center is an Arabic
  inscription of the Shahada (Muslim creed) below which are rays of
  the rising sun over the Takbir (Arabic expression meaning "God is
  great"), and at bottom center is a scroll bearing the name
  Afghanistan; black signifies the past, red is for the blood shed for
  independence, and green can represent either hope for the future,
  agricultural prosperity, or Islam
  note: Afghanistan had more changes to its national flag in the 20th
  century than any other country; the colors black, red, and green
  appeared on most of them

Akrotiri
  the flag of the UK is used

Albania
  red with a black two-headed eagle in the center; the design
  is claimed to be that of 15th-century hero George Castriota
  SKANDERBERG, who led a successful uprising against the Turks that
  resulted in a short-lived independence for some Albanian regions
  (1443-1478); an unsubstantiated explanation for the eagle symbol is
  the tradition that Albanians see themselves as descendants of the
  eagle; they refer to themselves as "Shkypetars," which translates as
  "sons of the eagle"

Algeria
  two equal vertical bands of green (hoist side) and white; a
  red, five-pointed star within a red crescent centered over the
  two-color boundary; the colors represent Islam (green), purity and
  peace (white), and liberty (red); the crescent and star are also
  Islamic symbols, but the crescent is more closed than those of other
  Muslim countries because the Algerians believe the long crescent
  horns bring happiness

American Samoa
  blue, with a white triangle edged in red that is
  based on the fly side and extends to the hoist side; a brown and
  white American bald eagle flying toward the hoist side is carrying
  two traditional Samoan symbols of authority, a war club known as a
  "Fa'alaufa'i" (upper; left talon), and a coconut fiber fly whisk
  known as a "Fue" (lower; right talon); the combination of symbols
  broadly mimics that seen on the US Great Seal and reflects the
  relationship between the United States and American Samoa

Andorra
  three vertical bands of blue (hoist side), yellow, and red,
  with the national coat of arms centered in the yellow band; the
  latter band is slightly wider than the other two so that the ratio
  of band widths is 8:9:8; the coat of arms features a quartered
  shield with the emblems of (starting in the upper left and
  proceeding clockwise): Urgell, Foix, Bearn, and Catalonia; the motto
  reads VIRTUS UNITA FORTIOR (Strength United is Stronger); the flag
  combines the blue and red French colors with the red and yellow of
  Spain to show Franco-Spanish protection
  note: similar to the flags of Chad and Romania, which do not have a
  national coat of arms in the center, and the flag of Moldova, which
  does bear a national emblem

Angola
  two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and black with a
  centered yellow emblem consisting of a five-pointed star within half
  a cogwheel crossed by a machete (in the style of a hammer and

  symbols characterize workers and peasants

Anguilla
  blue, with the flag of the UK in the upper hoist-side
  quadrant and the Anguillan coat of arms centered in the outer half

  faith, youth, and hope; the three dolphins stand for endurance,
  unity, and strength

Antigua and Barbuda
  red, with an inverted isosceles triangle based
  on the top edge of the flag; the triangle contains three horizontal
  bands of black (top), light blue, and white, with a yellow rising
  sun in the black band; the sun symbolizes the dawn of a new era,
  black represents the African heritage of most of the population,
  blue is for hope, and red is for the dynamism of the people; the "V"
  stands for victory; the successive yellow, blue, and white coloring
  is also meant to evoke the country's tourist attractions of sun,
  sea, and sand

Argentina
  three equal horizontal bands of light blue (top), white,
  and light blue; centered in the white band is a radiant yellow sun
  with a human face known as the Sun of May; the colors represent the
  clear skies and snow of the Andes; the sun symbol commemorates the
  appearance of the sun through cloudy skies on 25 May 1810 during the

  are those of Inti, the Inca god of the sun

  (Papiamento, Dutch, Spanish, English) as well as the four points of
  a compass, to indicate that its inhabitants come from all over the

  depicts one point for each of the six original states and one

  constellation in white with one small five-pointed star and four
  larger, seven-pointed stars

Austria
  three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red;

  national banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191,
  following a fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of
  Austria's white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon

  political parties: blue for the PUP and red for the UDP; various
  elements of the coat of arms - the figures, the tools, the mahogany
  tree, and the garland of leaves - recall the logging industry that
  led to British settlement of Belize
  note: Belize's flag is the only national flag that depicts human
  beings; two British overseas territories, Montserrat and the British
  Virgin Islands, also depict humans

Benin

  Empire of Brazil (1822-1889); on the imperial flag, the green
  represented the House of Braganza of Pedro I, the first Emperor of
  Brazil, while the yellow stood for the Habsburg Family of his wife;
  on the modern flag the green represents the forests of the country
  and the yellow rhombus its mineral wealth; the blue circle and
  stars, which replaced the coat of arms of the original flag, depict
  the sky over Rio de Janeiro on the morning of 15 November 1889 - the

  origin of the flag design vary, but the best known is a legend that
  the banner fell from the sky during an early-13th century battle;
  caught up by the Danish king before it ever touched the earth, this
  heavenly talisman inspired the royal army to victory; in actuality,
  the flag may derive from a crusade banner or ensign
