Introduction ::Fiji




Background:


Fiji became independent in 1970 after nearly a century as a British
colony. Democratic rule was interrupted by two military coups in
1987 caused by concern over a government perceived as dominated by
the Indian community (descendants of contract laborers brought to
the islands by the British in the 19th century). The coups and a
1990 constitution that cemented native Melanesian control of Fiji
led to heavy Indian emigration; the population loss resulted in
economic difficulties, but ensured that Melanesians became the
majority. A new constitution enacted in 1997 was more equitable.
Free and peaceful elections in 1999 resulted in a government led by
an Indo-Fijian, but a civilian-led coup in May 2000 ushered in a
prolonged period of political turmoil. Parliamentary elections held
in August 2001 provided Fiji with a democratically elected
government led by Prime Minister Laisenia QARASE. Re-elected in May
2006, QARASE was ousted in a December 2006 military coup led by
Commodore Voreqe BAINIMARAMA, who initially appointed himself acting
president but in January 2007 became interim prime minister. Since
taking power BAINIMARAMA has neutralized his opponents, crippled
Fiji's democratic institutions, and refused to hold elections.

Economy ::Fiji




Economy - overview:


Fiji, endowed with forest, mineral, and fish resources, is one of
the most developed of the Pacific island economies though still with
a large subsistence sector. Sugar exports, remittances from Fijians
working abroad, and a growing tourist industry - with 400,000 to
500,000 tourists annually - are the major sources of foreign
exchange. Fiji's sugar has special access to European Union markets
but will be harmed by the EU's decision to cut sugar subsidies.
Sugar processing makes up one-third of industrial activity but is
not efficient. Fiji's tourism industry was damaged by the December
2006 coup and is facing an uncertain recovery time. In 2007 tourist
arrivals were down almost 6%, with substantial job losses in the
service sector, and GDP dipped. The coup has created a difficult
business climate. The EU has suspended all aid until the interim
government takes steps toward new elections. Long-term problems
include low investment, uncertain land ownership rights, and the
government's inability to manage its budget. Overseas remittances
from Fijians working in Kuwait and Iraq have decreased
significantly. Fiji's current account deficit reached 23% of GDP in
2006.
