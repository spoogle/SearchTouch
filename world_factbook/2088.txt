Field Listing :: Independence

  For most countries, this entry gives the date that sovereignty was
  achieved and from which nation, empire, or trusteeship. For the
  other countries, the date given may not represent "independence" in
  the strict sense, but rather some significant nationhood event such
  as the traditional founding date or the date of unification,
  federation, confederation, establishment, fundamental change in the
  form of government, or state succession. For a number of countries,
  the establishment of statehood was a lengthy evolutionary process
  occurring over decades or even centuries. In such cases, several
  significant dates are cited. Dependent areas include the notation
  "none" followed by the nature of their dependency status. Also see
  the Terminology note.
