Netherlands  (Europe)

Introduction ::Netherlands




Background:


The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in
1579; during the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and
commercial power, with settlements and colonies around the world.
After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was
formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate
kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but
suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A
modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large
exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member
of NATO and the EEC (now the EU), and participated in the
introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former
Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands -
Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in
the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint
Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent
countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Flag description:


three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and blue; similar
to the flag of Luxembourg, which uses a lighter blue and is longer;
the colors were those of WILLIAM I, Prince of Orange, who led the
Dutch Revolt against Spanish sovereignty in the latter half of the
16th century; originally the upper band was orange, but because it
tended to fade to red over time, the red shade was eventually made
the permanent color; the banner is perhaps the oldest tricolor in
continuous use



National anthem:


name: "Het Wilhelmus" (The William)

lyrics/music: Philips VAN MARNIX van Sint Aldegonde
(presumed)/unknown

note: adopted 1932, in use since the 17th century, making it the
oldest national anthem in the world; also known as "Wilhelmus van
Nassouwe" (William of Nassau), it is in the form of an acrostic,
where the first letter of each stanza spells the name of the leader
of the Dutch Revolt







Economy ::Netherlands




Economy - overview:


The Netherlands economy is noted for stable industrial relations,
moderate unemployment and inflation, a sizable current account
surplus, and an important role as a European transportation hub.
Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals,
petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized
agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides
large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports.
The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating
the euro currency on 1 January 2002. The country has been one of the
leading European nations for attracting foreign direct investment
and is one of the four largest investors in the US. After 26 years
of uninterrupted economic growth, the Netherlands' economy - which
is highly open and dependent on foreign trade and financial services
- was hard-hit by global economic crisis. Dutch GDP contracted 3.9%
in 2009, while exports declined nearly 25% due to a sharp
contraction in world demand. The Dutch financial sector has also
suffered, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to
U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In response to turmoil in financial
markets, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions
of dollars into a third, to prevent further systemic risk. The
government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating
infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers
to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The
stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a
government budget deficit of nearly 4.6% of GDP in 2009 and 5.6% in
2010 that contrasts sharply with a surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2008.
With unemployment weighing on private-sector consumption, the
government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE is likely to come under
increased pressure to keep the budget deficit in check while
promoting economic recovery.
