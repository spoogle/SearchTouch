United Arab Emirates  (Middle East)

Introduction ::United Arab Emirates




Background:


The Trucial States of the Persian Gulf coast granted the UK control
of their defense and foreign affairs in 19th century treaties. In
1971, six of these states - Abu Zaby, 'Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash
Shariqah, Dubayy, and Umm al Qaywayn - merged to form the United
Arab Emirates (UAE). They were joined in 1972 by Ra's al Khaymah.
The UAE's per capita GDP is on par with those of leading West
European nations. Its generosity with oil revenues and its moderate
foreign policy stance have allowed the UAE to play a vital role in
the affairs of the region. For more than three decades, oil and
global finance drove the UAE's economy, however, in 2008-09, the
confluence of falling oil prices, collapsing real estate prices, and
the international banking crisis hit the UAE especially hard.

Economy ::United Arab Emirates




Economy - overview:


The UAE has an open economy with a high per capita income and a
sizable annual trade surplus. Successful efforts at economic
diversification have reduced the portion of GDP based on oil and gas
output to 25%. Since the discovery of oil in the UAE more than 30
years ago, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
with a high standard of living. The government has increased
spending on job creation and infrastructure expansion and is opening
up utilities to greater private sector involvement. In April 2004,
the UAE signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement with
Washington and in November 2004 agreed to undertake negotiations
toward a Free Trade Agreement with the US, however, those talks have
not moved forward. The country's Free Trade Zones - offering 100%
foreign ownership and zero taxes - are helping to attract foreign
investors. The global financial crisis, tight international credit,
and deflated asset prices slowed GDP growth in 2010. UAE authorities
tried to blunt the crisis by increasing spending and boosting
liquidity in the banking sector. The crisis hit Dubai hardest, as it
was heavily exposed to depressed real estate prices. Dubai lacked
sufficient cash to meet its debt obligations, prompting global
concern about its solvency. The UAE Central Bank and Abu Dhabi-based
banks bought the largest shares. In December 2009 Dubai received an
additional $10 billion loan from the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The
economy is expected to continue a slow rebound. Dependence on oil, a
large expatriate workforce, and growing inflation pressures are
significant long-term challenges. The UAE's strategic plan for the
next few years focuses on diversification and creating more
opportunities for nationals through improved education and increased
private sector employment.

Transnational Issues ::United Arab Emirates




Disputes - international:


boundary agreement was signed and ratified with Oman in 2003 for
entire border, including Oman's Musandam Peninsula and Al Madhah
enclaves, but contents of the agreement and detailed maps showing
the alignment have not been published; Iran and UAE dispute Tunb
Islands and Abu Musa Island, which Iran occupies



Illicit drugs:


the UAE is a drug transshipment point for traffickers given its
proximity to Southwest Asian drug-producing countries; the UAE's
position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable to money
laundering; anti-money-laundering controls improving, but informal
banking remains unregulated
