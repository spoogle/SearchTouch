Sierra Leone  (Africa)

Introduction ::Sierra Leone




Background:


Democracy is slowly being reestablished after the civil war from
1991 to 2002 that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the
displacement of more than 2 million people (about one-third of the
population). The military, which took over full responsibility for
security following the departure of UN peacekeepers at the end of
2005, is increasingly developing as a guarantor of the country's
stability. The armed forces remained on the sideline during the 2007
presidential election, but still look to the UN Integrated Office in
Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) - a civilian UN mission - to support efforts
to consolidate peace. The new government's priorities include
furthering development, creating jobs, and stamping out endemic
corruption.

Economy ::Sierra Leone




Economy - overview:


Sierra Leone is an extremely poor nation with tremendous inequality
in income distribution. While it possesses substantial mineral,
agricultural, and fishery resources, its physical and social
infrastructure has yet to recover from the civil war, and serious
social disorders continue to hamper economic development. Nearly
half of the working-age population engages in subsistence
agriculture. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of raw
materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market.
Alluvial diamond mining remains the major source of hard currency
earnings accounting for nearly half of Sierra Leone's exports. The
fate of the economy depends upon the maintenance of domestic peace
and the continued receipt of substantial aid from abroad, which is
essential to offset the severe trade imbalance and supplement
government revenues. The IMF has completed a Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility program that helped stabilize economic growth and
reduce inflation and in 2010 approved a new program worth $45
million over three years. Political stability has led to a revival
of economic activity such as the rehabilitation of bauxite and
rutile mining, which are set to benefit from planned tax incentives.
A number of offshore oil discoveries were announced in 2009 and
2010. The development on these reserves, which could be significant,
is still several years away.

continued occupation of these lands including the hamlet of Yenga
occupied since 1998
