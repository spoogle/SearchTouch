Seychelles  (Africa)

Introduction ::Seychelles




Background:


A lengthy struggle between France and Great Britain for the islands
ended in 1814, when they were ceded to the latter. Independence came
in 1976. Socialist rule was brought to a close with a new
constitution and free elections in 1993. President France-Albert
RENE, who had served since 1977, was re-elected in 2001, but stepped
down in 2004. Vice President James MICHEL took over the presidency
and in July 2006 was elected to a new five-year term.

Economy ::Seychelles




Economy - overview:


Since independence in 1976, per capita output in this Indian Ocean
archipelago has expanded to roughly seven times the
pre-independence, near-subsistence level, moving the island into the
upper-middle income group of countries. Growth has been led by the
tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and
provides more than 70% of hard currency earnings, and by tuna
fishing. In recent years, the government has encouraged foreign
investment to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time,
the government has moved to reduce the dependence on tourism by
promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale
manufacturing. GDP grew about 7-8% per year in 2006-07, driven by
tourism and a boom in tourism-related construction. The Seychelles
rupee was allowed to depreciate in 2006 after being overvalued for
years and fell by 10% in the first 9 months of 2007. Despite these
actions, the Seychelles economy has struggled to maintain its gains
and in 2008 suffered from food and oil price shocks, a foreign
exchange shortage, high inflation, large financing gaps, and the
global recession. In July 2008 the government defaulted on a Euro
amortizing note worth roughly US$80 million, leading to a
downgrading of Seychelles credit rating, but in October 2010 the EU
approved a $2.9 million grant as part of a larger four-year program
for Seychelles. In response to Seychelles successful implementation
of tighter monetary and fiscal policies, the IMF upgraded Seychelles
to a three-year exteneded fund facility (EFF) of $31 million in
December 2009. In 2008, GDP fell more than 1% due to declining
tourism, but the economy recovered in 2009-10 with a notable
increase in tourist numbers for 2010.
