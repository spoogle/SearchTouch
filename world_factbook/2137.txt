  personnel or equipment for scientific research or for any other
  peaceful purposes

Argentina
  the Argentine military is a well-organized force

  on the state of Cuban equipment; the army remains well trained and

  existing equipment has increasingly affected operational
  capabilities, Cuba remains able to offer considerable resistance to
  any regional power (2010)

  France, Germany, Belgium, Spain, and Luxembourg - has deployed
  troops and police on peacekeeping missions to Bosnia-Herzegovina,
  Macedonia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and assumed
  command of the ISAF in Afghanistan in August 2004; Eurocorps
  directly commands the 5,000-man Franco-German Brigade, the
  Multinational Command Support Brigade, and EUFOR in Bosnia and
  Herzegovina; in November 2004, the EU Council of Ministers formally
  committed to creating 13 1,500-man battle groups by the end of 2007,
  to respond to international crises on a rotating basis; 22 of the
  EU's 27 nations have agreed to supply troops; France, Italy, and the
  UK formed the first of three battle groups in 2005; Norway, Sweden,

  US-manned Icelandic Defense Force (IDF) headquartered at Keflavik;
  however, all US military forces in Iceland were withdrawn as of
  October 2006; although wartime defense of Iceland remains a NATO

Laos
  serving one of the world's least developed countries, the Lao
  People's Armed Forces (LPAF) is small, poorly funded, and
  ineffectively resourced; its mission focus is border and internal
  security, primarily in countering ethnic Hmong insurgent groups;
  together with the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and the
  government, the Lao People's Army (LPA) is the third pillar of state
  machinery, and as such is expected to suppress political and civil
  unrest and similar national emergencies, but the LPA also has
  upgraded skills to respond to avian influenza outbreaks; there is no
  perceived external threat to the state and the LPA maintains strong
  ties with the neighboring Vietnamese military (2008)

Lesotho
  Lesotho's declared policy is maintenance of its independent
  sovereignty and preservation of internal security; in practice,
  external security is guaranteed by South Africa; restructuring of
  the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) and Ministry of Defense and Public
  Service over the past five years has focused on subordinating the
  defense apparatus to civilian control and restoring the LDF's
  cohesion; the restructuring has considerably improved capabilities
  and professionalism, but the LDF is disproportionately large for a
  small, poor country; the government has outlined a reduction to a
  planned 1,500-man strength, but these plans have met with vociferous
  resistance from the political opposition and from inside the LDF
  (2008)

Liechtenstein
  Liechtenstein has no military forces but is interested
  in European security policy and is an active member of the
  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)

Macau
  defense is the responsibility of China

Maldives
  the Maldives National Defense Force (MNDF), with its small
  size and with little serviceable equipment, is inadequate to prevent

  Maldives Police Service (MPS) and ensure security in the exclusive
  economic zone (2008)

Panama
  on 10 February 1990, the government of then President ENDARA
  abolished Panama's military and reformed the security apparatus by
  creating the Panamanian Public Forces; in October 1994, Panama's

San Marino
  defense is the responsibility of Italy

Sao Tome and Principe
  Sao Tome and Principe's army is a tiny force
  with almost no resources at its disposal and would be wholly
  ineffective operating unilaterally; infantry equipment is considered
  simple to operate and maintain but may require refurbishment or
  replacement after 25 years in tropical climates; poor pay, working
  conditions, and alleged nepotism in the promotion of officers have
  been problems in the past, as reflected in the 1995 and 2003 coups;
  these issues are being addressed with foreign assistance aimed at
  improving the army and its focus on realistic security concerns;
  command is exercised from the president, through the Minister of
  Defense, to the Chief of the Armed Forces staff (2005)

Sint Maarten
  defense is the responsibility of the Kingdom of the
  Netherlands

South Africa
  with the end of apartheid and the establishment of

  considered complete

  on 9 February 1920; Norwegian military activity is limited to
  fisheries surveillance by the Norwegian Coast Guard

Tokelau

Turkey
  a "National Security Policy Document" adopted in October 2005
  increases the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) role in internal security,
  augmenting the General Directorate of Security and Gendarmerie
  General Command (Jandarma); the TSK leadership continues to play a
  key role in politics and considers itself guardian of Turkey's
  secular state; in April 2007, it warned the ruling party about any
  pro-Islamic appointments; despite on-going negotiations on EU
  accession since October 2005, progress has been limited in
  establishing required civilian supremacy over the military; primary
  domestic threats are listed as fundamentalism (with the definition
  in some dispute with the civilian government), separatism (the
  Kurdish problem), and the extreme left wing; Ankara strongly opposed
  establishment of an autonomous Kurdish region; an overhaul of the
  Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) taking place under the "Force
  2014" program is to produce 20-30% smaller, more highly trained
  forces characterized by greater mobility and firepower and capable
  of joint and combined operations; the TLFC has taken on increasing
  international peacekeeping responsibilities, and took charge of a
  NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) command in
  Afghanistan in April 2007; the Turkish Navy is a regional naval
  power that wants to develop the capability to project power beyond
  Turkey's coastal waters; the Navy is heavily involved in NATO,
  multinational, and UN operations; its roles include control of
  territorial waters and security for sea lines of communications; the
  Turkish Air Force adopted an "Aerospace and Missile Defense Concept"
  in 2002 and has initiated project work on an integrated missile
  defense system; Air Force priorities include attaining a modern
  deployable, survivable, and sustainable force structure, and
  establishing a sustainable command and control system (2008)
