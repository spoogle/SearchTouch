Hungary  (Europe)

Introduction ::Hungary




Background:


Hungary became a Christian kingdom in A.D. 1000 and for many
centuries served as a bulwark against Ottoman Turkish expansion in
Europe. The kingdom eventually became part of the polyglot
Austro-Hungarian Empire, which collapsed during World War I. The
country fell under Communist rule following World War II. In 1956, a
revolt and an announced withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact were met
with a massive military intervention by Moscow. Under the leadership
of Janos KADAR in 1968, Hungary began liberalizing its economy,
introducing so-called "Goulash Communism." Hungary held its first
multiparty elections in 1990 and initiated a free market economy. It
joined NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004.

three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and green; the
flag dates to the national movement of the 18th and 19th centuries,
and fuses the medieval colors of the Hungarian coat of arms with the
revolutionary tricolor form of the French flag; folklore attributes
virtues to the colors: red for strength, white for faithfulness, and
green for hope; alternatively, the red is seen as being for the
blood spilled in defense of the land, white for freedom, and green
for the pasturelands that make up so much of the country

Economy ::Hungary




Economy - overview:


Hungary has made the transition from a centrally planned to a market
economy, with a per capita income nearly two-thirds that of the
EU-25 average. The private sector accounts for more than 80% of GDP.
Foreign ownership of and investment in Hungarian firms are
widespread, with cumulative foreign direct investment worth more
than $70 billion. The government's austerity measures, imposed since
late 2006, have reduced the budget deficit from over 9% of GDP in
2006 to 3.8% in 2010. Hungary's impending inability to service its
short-term debt - brought on by the global financial crisis in late
2008 - led Budapest to obtain an IMF-arranged financial assistance
package worth over $25 billion. The global economic downturn,
declining exports, and low domestic consumption and fixed asset
accumulation, dampened by government austerity measures, resulted in
an economic contraction of 6.3% in 2009. The economy rebounded in
2010 with a big boost from exports, and growth of more than 2.5% is
expected in 2011. Unemployment remained high, at more than 11%.
