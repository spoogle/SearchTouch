Flag description:


a yellow three-masted sailing ship facing the hoist side rides on a
blue background with scattered, white, wavy lines under the ship; a
continuous black-over-white wavy line divides the ship from the
white wavy lines; on the hoist side, a vertical band is divided into
three parts: the top part (called ikkurina) is red with a green
diagonal cross extending to the corners overlaid by a white cross
dividing the rectangle into four sections; the middle part has a
white background with an ermine pattern; the third part has a red
background with two stylized yellow lions outlined in black, one
above the other; these three heraldic arms represent settlement by
colonists from the Basque Country (top), Brittany, and Normandy; the
blue on the main portion of the flag symbolizes the Atlantic Ocean
and the stylized ship represents the Grande Hermine in which Jacques
Cartier "discovered" the islands in 1536

Economy ::Saint Pierre and Miquelon




Economy - overview:


The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by
fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because of
disputes with Canada over fishing quotas and a steady decline in the
number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre. In 1992, an arbitration
panel awarded the islands an exclusive economic zone of 12,348 sq km
to settle a longstanding territorial dispute with Canada, although
it represents only 25% of what France had sought. France heavily
subsidizes the islands to the great betterment of living standards.
The government hopes an expansion of tourism will boost economic
prospects. Fish farming, crab fishing, and agriculture are being
developed to diversify the local economy. Recent test drilling for
oil may pave the way for development of the energy sector.
