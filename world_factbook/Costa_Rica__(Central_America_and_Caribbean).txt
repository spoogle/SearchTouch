Costa Rica  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Costa Rica




Background:


Although explored by the Spanish early in the 16th century, initial
attempts at colonizing Costa Rica proved unsuccessful due to a
combination of factors, including: disease from mosquito-infested
swamps, brutal heat, resistance by natives, and pirate raids. It was
not until 1563 that a permanent settlement of Cartago was
established in the cooler, fertile central highlands. The area
remained a colony for some two and a half centuries. In 1821, Costa
Rica became one of several Central American provinces that jointly
declared their independence from Spain. Two years later it joined
the United Provinces of Central America, but this federation
disintegrated in 1838, at which time Costa Rica proclaimed its
sovereignty and independence. Since the late 19th century, only two
brief periods of violence have marred the country's democratic
development. Although it still maintains a large agricultural
sector, Costa Rica has expanded its economy to include strong
technology and tourism industries. The standard of living is
relatively high. Land ownership is widespread.

Flag description:


five horizontal bands of blue (top), white, red (double width),
white, and blue, with the coat of arms in a white elliptical disk
toward the hoist side of the red band; Costa Rica retained the
earlier blue-white-blue flag of Central America until 1848 when, in
response to revolutionary activity in Europe, it was decided to
incorporate the French colors into the national flag and a central
red stripe was added; today the blue color is said to stand for the
sky, opportunity, and perseverence, white denotes peace, happiness,
and wisdom, while red represents the blood shed for freedom, as well
as the generosity and vibrancy of the people

note: somewhat resembles the flag of North Korea; similar to the
flag of Thailand but with the blue and red colors reversed



National anthem:


name: "Himno Nacional de Costa Rica" (National Anthem of Costa Rica)

lyrics/music: Jose Maria ZELEDON Brenes/Manuel Maria GUTIERREZ

note: adopted 1949; the anthem's music was originally written for an
1853 welcome ceremony for diplomatic missions from the United States
and United Kingdom; the lyrics were added in 1903







Economy ::Costa Rica




Economy - overview:


Prior to the global economic crisis, Costa Rica enjoyed stable
economic growth. The economy contracted 0.7% in 2009, but resumed
growth at more than 3% in 2010. While the traditional agricultural
exports of bananas, coffee, sugar, and beef are still the backbone
of commodity export trade, a variety of industrial and specialized
agricultural products have broadened export trade in recent years.
High value added goods and services, including microchips, have
further bolstered exports. Tourism continues to bring in foreign
exchange, as Costa Rica's impressive biodiversity makes it a key
destination for ecotourism. Foreign investors remain attracted by
the country's political stability and relatively high education
levels, as well as the fiscal incentives offered in the free-trade
zones; and Costa Rica has attracted one of the highest levels of
foreign direct investment per capita in Latin America. However, many
business impediments, such as high levels of bureaucracy, difficulty
of enforcing contracts, and weak investor protection, remain.
Poverty has remained around 15-20% for nearly 20 years, and the
strong social safety net that had been put into place by the
government has eroded due to increased financial constraints on
government expenditures. Unlike the rest of Central America, Costa
Rica is not highly dependent on remittances as they only represent
about 2% of GDP. Immigration from Nicaragua has increasingly become
a concern for the government. The estimated 300,000-500,000
Nicaraguans in Costa Rica legally and illegally are an important
source of - mostly unskilled - labor, but also place heavy demands
on the social welfare system. The US-Central American-Dominican
Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) entered into force on 1
January 2009, after significant delays within the Costa Rican
legislature. CAFTA-DR will likely lead to increased foreign direct
investment in key sectors of the economy, including the insurance
and telecommunications sectors recently opened to private investors.
President CHINCHILLA is likely to push for fiscal reform in the
coming year, seeking to boost revenue, possibly through revised tax
legislation, to fund an increase in security services and education.
