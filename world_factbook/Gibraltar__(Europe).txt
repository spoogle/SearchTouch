Gibraltar  (Europe)

Introduction ::Gibraltar




Background:


Strategically important, Gibraltar was reluctantly ceded to Great
Britain by Spain in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht; the British garrison
was formally declared a colony in 1830. In a referendum held in
1967, Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain a British
dependency. The subsequent granting of autonomy in 1969 by the UK
led to Spain closing the border and severing all communication
links. A series of talks were held by the UK and Spain between 1997
and 2002 on establishing temporary joint sovereignty over Gibraltar.
In response to these talks, the Gibraltar Government called a
referendum in late 2002 in which the majority of citizens voted
overwhelmingly against any sharing of sovereignty with Spain. Since
late 2004, tripartite talks among Spain, the UK, and Gibraltar have
been held with the aim of cooperatively resolving problems that
affect the local population, and work continues on cooperation
agreements in areas such as taxation and financial services;
communications and maritime security; policy, legal and customs
services; environmental protection; and education and visa services.
Throughout 2009, a dispute over Gibraltar's claim to territorial
waters extending out three miles gave rise to periodic non-violent
maritime confrontations between Spanish and UK naval patrols. A new
noncolonial constitution came into effect in 2007, and the European
Court of First Instance recognized Gibraltar's right to regulate its
own tax regime in December 2008, but the UK retains responsibility
for defense, foreign relations, internal security, and financial
stability.

Economy ::Gibraltar




Economy - overview:


Self-sufficient Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade,
offshore banking, and its position as an international conference
center. Tax rates are low to attract foreign investment. The British
military presence has been sharply reduced and now contributes about
7% to the local economy, compared with 60% in 1984. The financial
sector, tourism (almost 5 million visitors in 1998), gaming
revenues, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer goods also
generate revenue. The financial sector, tourism, and the shipping
sector contribute 30%, 30%, and 25%, respectively, of GDP.
Telecommunications, e-commerce, and e-gaming account for the
remaining 15%. In recent years, Gibraltar has seen major structural
change from a public to a private sector economy, but changes in
government spending still have a major impact on the level of
employment.
