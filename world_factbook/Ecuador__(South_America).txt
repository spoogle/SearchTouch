Ecuador  (South America)

Introduction ::Ecuador




Background:


What is now Ecuador formed part of the northern Inca Empire until
the Spanish conquest in 1533. Quito became a seat of Spanish
colonial government in 1563 and part of the Viceroyalty of New
Granada in 1717. The territories of the Viceroyalty - New Granada
(Colombia), Venezuela, and Quito - gained their independence between
1819 and 1822 and formed a federation known as Gran Colombia. When
Quito withdrew in 1830, the traditional name was changed in favor of
the "Republic of the Equator." Between 1904 and 1942, Ecuador lost
territories in a series of conflicts with its neighbors. A border
war with Peru that flared in 1995 was resolved in 1999. Although
Ecuador marked 30 years of civilian governance in 2004, the period
has been marred by political instability. Protests in Quito
contributed to the mid-term ouster of three of Ecuador's last four
democratically elected Presidents. In September 2008, voters
approved a new constitution; Ecuador's twentieth since gaining
independence. General elections, under the new constitutional
framework, were held in April 2009, and voters re-elected President
Rafael CORREA.

Economy ::Ecuador




Economy - overview:


Ecuador is substantially dependent on its petroleum resources, which
have accounted for more than half of the country's export earnings
and one-fourth of public sector revenues in recent years. In
1999/2000, Ecuador suffered a severe economic crisis, with GDP
contracting by more than 6%. Poverty increased significantly, the
banking system collapsed, and Ecuador defaulted on its external debt
later that year. In March 2000, the Congress approved a series of
structural reforms that also provided for the adoption of the US
dollar as legal tender. Dollarization stabilized the economy, and
positive growth returned in the years that followed, helped by high
oil prices, remittances, and increased non-traditional exports. From
2002-06 the economy grew 5.5%, the highest five-year average in 25
years. After moderate growth in 2007, the economy reached a growth
rate of 7.2% in 2008, in large part due to high global petroleum
prices. President Rafael CORREA, who took office in January 2007,
defaulted on Ecuador's sovereign debt in December 2008, refusing to
make payment on $3.2 billion in international bonds, representing
over 80% of Ecuador's private external debt. Economic policies under
the CORREA administration - including an announcement in late 2009
terminating 13 bilateral investment treaties - have generated
economic uncertainty and discouraged private investment. The
Ecuadorian economy slowed to 0.4% growth in 2009 due to the global
financial crisis, and the sharp decline in world oil prices and
remittance flows, but picked up to a 2.4% growth rate in 2010.
