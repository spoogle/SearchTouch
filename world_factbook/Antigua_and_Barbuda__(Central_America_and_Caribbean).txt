Antigua and Barbuda  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Antigua and Barbuda




Background:


The Siboney were the first to inhabit the islands of Antigua and
Barbuda in 2400 B.C., but Arawak Indians populated the islands when
COLUMBUS landed on his second voyage in 1493. Early settlements by
the Spanish and French were succeeded by the English who formed a
colony in 1667. Slavery, established to run the sugar plantations on
Antigua, was abolished in 1834. The islands became an independent
state within the British Commonwealth of Nations in 1981.

Economy ::Antigua and Barbuda




Economy - overview:


Tourism continues to dominate Antigua and Barbuda's economy,
accounting for nearly 60% of GDP and 40% of investment. The
dual-island nation's agricultural production is focused on the
domestic market and constrained by a limited water supply and a
labor shortage stemming from the lure of higher wages in tourism and
construction. Manufacturing comprises enclave-type assembly for
export with major products being bedding, handicrafts, and
electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the medium
term will continue to depend on tourist arrivals from the US,
Canada, and Europe and potential damages from natural disasters.
After taking office in 2004, the SPENCER government adopted an
ambitious fiscal reform program, and was successful in reducing its
public debt-to-GDP ratio from 120% to about 90% in 2008. However,
the global financial crisis that began in 2008, has led to a
significant increase in the national debt, which topped 130% at the
end of 2010. The Antiguan economy experienced solid growth from 2003
to 2007, reaching over 12% in 2006 driven by a construction boom in
hotels and housing associated with the Cricket World Cup, but growth
dropped off in 2008 with the end of the boom. In 2009, Antigua's
economy was severely hit by the global economic crisis, suffering
from the collapse of its largest financial institution and a steep
decline in tourism. This decline continued in 2010 as the country
struggled with a yawning budget deficit.
