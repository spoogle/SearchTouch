Poland  (Europe)

Introduction ::Poland




Background:


Poland is an ancient nation that was conceived near the middle of
the 10th century. Its golden age occurred in the 16th century.
During the following century, the strengthening of the gentry and
internal disorders weakened the nation. In a series of agreements
between 1772 and 1795, Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned
Poland amongst themselves. Poland regained its independence in 1918
only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in World War II.
It became a Soviet satellite state following the war, but its
government was comparatively tolerant and progressive. Labor turmoil
in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union
"Solidarity" that over time became a political force and by 1990 had
swept parliamentary elections and the presidency. A "shock therapy"
program during the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its
economy into one of the most robust in Central Europe, but Poland
still faces the lingering challenges of high unemployment,
underdeveloped and dilapidated infrastructure, and a poor rural
underclass. Solidarity suffered a major defeat in the 2001
parliamentary elections when it failed to elect a single deputy to
the lower house of Parliament, and the new leaders of the Solidarity
Trade Union subsequently pledged to reduce the Trade Union's
political role. Poland joined NATO in 1999 and the European Union in
2004. With its transformation to a democratic, market-oriented
country largely completed, Poland is an increasingly active member
of Euro-Atlantic organizations.

Coastline:


440 km



Maritime claims:


territorial sea: 12 nm

exclusive economic zone: defined by international treaties



Climate:


temperate with cold, cloudy, moderately severe winters with frequent
precipitation; mild summers with frequent showers and thundershowers



Terrain:


mostly flat plain; mountains along southern border



Elevation extremes:

Environment - current issues:


situation has improved since 1989 due to decline in heavy industry
and increased environmental concern by post-Communist governments;
air pollution nonetheless remains serious because of sulfur dioxide
emissions from coal-fired power plants, and the resulting acid rain
has caused forest damage; water pollution from industrial and
municipal sources is also a problem, as is disposal of hazardous
wastes; pollution levels should continue to decrease as industrial
establishments bring their facilities up to EU code, but at
substantial cost to business and the government

lack of natural barriers on the North European Plain

note: adopted 1927; the anthem, commonly known as "Jeszcze Polska
nie zginela" (Poland Has Not Yet Perished), was written in 1797; the
lyrics resonate strongly with Poles because they reflect the
numerous occasions in which the nation's lands have been occupied







Economy ::Poland




Economy - overview:


Poland has pursued a policy of economic liberalization since 1990
and today stands out as a success story among transition economies.
Before 2009, GDP had grown about 5% annually, based on rising
private consumption, a jump in corporate investment, and EU funds
inflows. GDP per capita is still much below the EU average, but is
similar to that of the three Baltic states. Since 2004, EU
membership and access to EU structural funds have provided a major
boost to the economy. Unemployment fell rapidly to 6.4% in October
2008, but climbed back to 11.8% for the year 2010, exceeding the EU
average by more than 2%. In 2008 inflation reached 4.2%, more than
the upper limit of the National Bank of Poland's target range, but
fell to 2.4% in 2010 due to global economic slowdown. Poland's
economic performance could improve over the longer term if the
country addresses some of the remaining deficiencies in its road and
rail infrastructure and its business environment. An inefficient
commercial court system, a rigid labor code, bureaucratic red tape,
burdensome tax system, and persistent low-level corruption keep the
private sector from performing up to its full potential. Rising
demands to fund health care, education, and the state pension system
caused the public sector budget deficit to rise to 7.9% of GDP in
2010. The PO/PSL coalition government, which came to power in
November 2007, plans to reduce the budget deficit in 2011 and has
also announced its intention to enact business-friendly reforms,
increase workforce participation, reduce public sector spending
growth, lower taxes, and accelerate privatization. The government,
however, has moved slowly on major reforms. The legislature passed a
law significantly limiting early retirement benefits. A health-care
bill also passed through the legislature, but the legislature failed
to overturn a presidential veto.

Intelsat, Eutelsat, Inmarsat, and Intersputnik (2009)
