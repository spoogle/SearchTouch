Introduction ::Romania




Background:


The principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia - for centuries under
the suzerainty of the Turkish Ottoman Empire - secured their
autonomy in 1856; they united in 1859 and a few years later adopted
the new name of Romania. The country gained recognition of its
independence in 1878. It joined the Allied Powers in World War I and
acquired new territories - most notably Transylvania - following the
conflict. In 1940, Romania allied with the Axis powers and
participated in the 1941 German invasion of the USSR. Three years
later, overrun by the Soviets, Romania signed an armistice. The
post-war Soviet occupation led to the formation of a Communist
"people's republic" in 1947 and the abdication of the king. The
decades-long rule of dictator Nicolae CEAUSESCU, who took power in
1965, and his Securitate police state became increasingly oppressive
and draconian through the 1980s. CEAUSESCU was overthrown and
executed in late 1989. Former Communists dominated the government
until 1996 when they were swept from power. Romania joined NATO in
2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy ::Romania




Economy - overview:


Romania, which joined the European Union on 1 January 2007, began
the transition from Communism in 1989 with a largely obsolete
industrial base and a pattern of output unsuited to the country's
needs. The country emerged in 2000 from a punishing three-year
recession thanks to strong demand in EU export markets. Domestic
consumption and investment have fueled strong GDP growth in recent
years, but have led to large current account imbalances. Romania's
macroeconomic gains have only recently started to spur creation of a
middle class and address Romania's widespread poverty. Corruption
and red tape continue to handicap its business environment.
Inflation rose in 2007-08, driven in part by strong consumer demand
and high wage growth, rising energy costs, a nation-wide drought
affecting food prices, and a relaxation of fiscal discipline.
Romania's GDP contracted markedly in the last quarter of 2008 as the
country began to feel the effects of a global downturn in financial
markets and trade, and GDP fell more than 7% in 2009, prompting
Bucharest to seek a $26 billion emergency assistance package from
the IMF, the EU, and other international lenders. Drastic austerity
measures, as part of Romania's IMF-led agreement led to a further
1.9% GDP contraction in 2010. The economy is expected to return to
positive growth in 2011.

Illicit drugs:

a narcotics conduit leaves it vulnerable to laundering, which occurs
via the banking system, currency exchange houses, and casinos
