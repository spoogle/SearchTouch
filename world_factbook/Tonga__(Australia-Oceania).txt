Tonga  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Tonga




Background:


Tonga - unique among Pacific nations - never completely lost its
indigenous governance. The archipelagos of "The Friendly Islands"
were united into a Polynesian kingdom in 1845. Tonga became a
constitutional monarchy in 1875 and a British protectorate in 1900;
it withdrew from the protectorate and joined the Commonwealth of
Nations in 1970. Tonga remains the only monarchy in the Pacific.

Economy ::Tonga




Economy - overview:


Tonga has a small, open, South Pacific island economy. It has a
narrow export base in agricultural goods. Squash, vanilla beans, and
yams are the main crops. Agricultural exports, including fish, make
up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high
proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The country remains
dependent on external aid and remittances from Tongan communities
overseas to offset its trade deficit. Tourism is the second-largest
source of hard currency earnings following remittances. Tonga had
39,000 visitors in 2006. The government is emphasizing the
development of the private sector, especially the encouragement of
investment, and is committing increased funds for health and
education. Tonga has a reasonably sound basic infrastructure and
well developed social services. High unemployment among the young, a
continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for democratic reform, and
rising civil service expenditures are major issues facing the
government.
