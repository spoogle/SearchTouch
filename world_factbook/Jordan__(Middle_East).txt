Jordan  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Jordan




Background:


Following World War I and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, the
UK received a mandate to govern much of the Middle East. Britain
separated out a semi-autonomous region of Transjordan from Palestine
in the early 1920s, and the area gained its independence in 1946; it
adopted the name of Jordan in 1950. The country's long-time ruler
was King HUSSEIN (1953-99). A pragmatic leader, he successfully
navigated competing pressures from the major powers (US, USSR, and
UK), various Arab states, Israel, and a large internal Palestinian
population. Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 war and
barely managed to defeat Palestinian rebels who attempted to
overthrow the monarchy in 1970. King HUSSEIN in 1988 permanently
relinquished Jordanian claims to the West Bank. In 1989, he
reinstituted parliamentary elections and initiated a gradual
political liberalization; political parties were legalized in 1992.
In 1994, he signed a peace treaty with Israel. King ABDALLAH II, the
son of King HUSSEIN, assumed the throne following his father's death
in February 1999. Since then, he has consolidated his power and
undertaken an aggressive economic reform program. Jordan acceded to
the World Trade Organization in 2000, and began to participate in
the European Free Trade Association in 2001. In 2003, Jordan
staunchly supported the Coalition ouster of Saddam in Iraq and
following the outbreak of insurgent violence in Iraq, absorbed
thousands of displaced Iraqis. Municipal elections were held in July
2007 under a system in which 20% of seats in all municipal councils
were reserved by quota for women. Parliamentary elections were held
in November 2010 and saw independent pro-government candidates win
the vast majority of seats.

Economy ::Jordan




Economy - overview:


Jordan's economy is among the smallest in the Middle East, with
insufficient supplies of water, oil, and other natural resources,
underlying the government's heavy reliance on foreign assistance.
Other economic challenges for the government include chronic high
rates of poverty, unemployment, inflation, and a large budget
deficit. Since assuming the throne in 1999, King ABDALLAH has
implemented significant economic reforms, such as opening the trade
regime, privatizing state-owned companies, and eliminating most fuel
subsidies, which in the past few years have spurred economic growth
by attracting foreign investment and creating some jobs. The global
economic slowdown, however, has depressed Jordan's GDP growth.
Export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and the
transport of re-exports have been hit the hardest. The Government
approved two supplementary budgets in 2010, but sweeping tax cuts
planned for 2010 did not materialize because of Amman's need for
additional revenue to cover excess spending. The budget deficit is
likely to remain high, at 5-6% of GDP, and Amman likely will
continue to depend heavily on foreign assistance to finance the
deficit in 2011. Jordan's financial sector has been relatively
isolated from the international financial crisis because of its
limited exposure to overseas capital markets. Jordan is currently
exploring nuclear power generation to forestall energy shortfalls.

Telephones - mobile cellular:

Telephone system:


general assessment: service has improved recently with increased use
of digital switching equipment; microwave radio relay transmission
and coaxial and fiber-optic cable are employed on trunk lines;
growing mobile-cellular usage in both urban and rural areas is
reducing use of fixed-line services; Internet penetration remains
modest and slow-growing

domestic: 1995 telecommunications law opened all non-fixed-line
services to private competition; in 2005, monopoly over fixed-line
services terminated and the entire telecommunications sector was
opened to competition; currently multiple mobile-cellular providers
with subscribership rapidly approaching 100 per 100 persons
