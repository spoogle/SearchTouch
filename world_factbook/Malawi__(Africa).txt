Malawi  (Africa)

Introduction ::Malawi




Background:


Established in 1891, the British protectorate of Nyasaland became
the independent nation of Malawi in 1964. After three decades of
one-party rule under President Hastings Kamuzu BANDA the country
held multiparty elections in 1994, under a provisional constitution
that came into full effect the following year. Current President
Bingu wa MUTHARIKA, elected in May 2004 after a failed attempt by
the previous president to amend the constitution to permit another
term, struggled to assert his authority against his predecessor and
subsequently started his own party, the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) in 2005. As president, MUTHARIKA has overseen economic
improvement but because of political deadlock in the legislature,
his minority party has been unable to pass significant legislation,
and anti-corruption measures have stalled. Population growth,
increasing pressure on agricultural lands, corruption, and the
spread of HIV/AIDS pose major problems for Malawi. MUTHARIKA was
reelected to a second term in May 2009.

Economy ::Malawi




Economy - overview:


Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's most densely populated and
least developed countries. The economy is predominately agricultural
with about 80% of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture,
which has benefited from fertilizer subsidies since 2006, accounts
for more than one-third of GDP and 90% of export revenues. The
performance of the tobacco sector is key to short-term growth as
tobacco accounts for more than half of exports. The economy depends
on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the
World Bank, and individual donor nations. In 2006, Malawi was
approved for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
program. In December 2007, the US granted Malawi eligibility status
to receive financial support within the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) initiative. The government faces many challenges
including developing a market economy, improving educational
facilities, facing up to environmental problems, dealing with the
rapidly growing problem of HIV/AIDS, and satisfying foreign donors
that fiscal discipline is being tightened. Since 2005 President
MUTHARIKA'S government has exhibited improved financial discipline
under the guidance of Finance Minister Goodall GONDWE and signed a
three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility worth $56 million
with the IMF. Improved relations with the IMF lead other
international donors to resume aid as well. The government has
announced infrastructure projects that could yield improvements,
such as a new oil pipeline, for better fuel access, and the
potential for a waterway link through Mozambican rivers to the
ocean, for better transportation options. Since 2009, however,
Malawi experienced some setbacks, including a general shortage of
foreign exchange, which has damaged its ability to pay for imports,
and fuel shortages that hinder transportation and productivity.
Investment fell 23% in 2009. The government has failed to address
barriers to investment such as unreliable power, water shortages,
poor telecommunications infrastructure, and the high costs of
services.
