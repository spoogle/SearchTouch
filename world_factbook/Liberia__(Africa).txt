Liberia  (Africa)

Introduction ::Liberia




Background:


Settlement of freed slaves from the US in what is today Liberia
began in 1822; by 1847, the Americo-Liberians were able to establish
a republic. William TUBMAN, president from 1944-71, did much to
promote foreign investment and to bridge the economic, social, and
political gaps between the descendents of the original settlers and
the inhabitants of the interior. In 1980, a military coup led by
Samuel DOE ushered in a decade of authoritarian rule. In December
1989, Charles TAYLOR launched a rebellion against DOE's regime that
led to a prolonged civil war in which DOE himself was killed. A
period of relative peace in 1997 allowed for elections that brought
TAYLOR to power, but major fighting resumed in 2000. An August 2003
peace agreement ended the war and prompted the resignation of former
president Charles TAYLOR, who faces war crimes charges in The Hague
related to his involvement in Sierra Leone's civil war. After two
years of rule by a transitional government, democratic elections in
late 2005 brought President Ellen JOHNSON SIRLEAF to power. The UN
Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) maintains a strong presence throughout
the country, but the security situation is still fragile and the
process of rebuilding the social and economic structure of this
war-torn country continues.

Economy ::Liberia




Economy - overview:


Liberia is a low income country heavily reliant on foreign
assistance for revenue. Civil war and government mismanagement
destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the infrastructure
in and around the capital, Monrovia. Many businesses fled the
country, taking capital and expertise with them, but with the
conclusion of fighting and the installation of a
democratically-elected government in 2006, several have returned.
Liberia has the distinction of having the highest ratio of direct
foreign investment to GDP in the world. Richly endowed with water,
mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products,
primarily raw timber and rubber and is reviving those sectors. Local
manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
President JOHNSON SIRLEAF, a Harvard-trained banker and
administrator, has taken steps to reduce corruption, build support
from international donors, and encourage private investment.
Embargos on timber and diamond exports have been lifted, opening new
sources of revenue for the government and Liberia shipped its first
major timber exports to Europe in 2010. The country reached its
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative completion point in 2010
and nearly $5 billion of international debt was permanently
eliminated. This new status will enable Liberia to estabilish a
sovereign credit rating and issue bonds. Liberia's Paris Club
creditors agreed to cancel Liberia's debt as well. Rebuilding
infrastructure and raising incomes will depend on generous financial
and technical assistance from donor countries and foreign investment
in key sectors, such as infrastructure and power generation.

Transnational Issues ::Liberia




Disputes - international:


although civil unrest continues to abate with the assistance of
18,000 UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) peacekeepers, as of January
2007, Liberian refugees still remain in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire,
Sierra Leone, and Ghana; Liberia, in turn, shelters refugees fleeing
turmoil in Cote d'Ivoire; despite the presence of over 9,000 UN
forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict
continues to spread into neighboring states who can no longer send
their migrant workers to Ivorian cocoa plantations; UN sanctions ban
Liberia from exporting diamonds and timber



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 12,600 (Cote d'Ivoire)

IDPs: 13,000 (civil war from 1990-2004; IDP resettlement began in
November 2004) (2007)



Illicit drugs:


transshipment point for Southeast and Southwest Asian heroin and
South American cocaine for the European and US markets; corruption,
criminal activity, arms-dealing, and diamond trade provide
significant potential for money laundering, but the lack of
well-developed financial system limits the country's utility as a
major money-laundering center
