Field Listing :: Literacy

  This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau
  percentages for the total population, males, and females. There are
  no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise
  specified, all rates are based on the most common definition - the
  ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the
  standards that individual countries use to assess the ability to
  read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on
  literacy, while not a perfect measure of educational results, is
  probably the most easily available and valid for international
  comparisons. Low levels of literacy, and education in general, can
  impede the economic development of a country in the current rapidly
  changing, technology-driven world.
