Ghana  (Africa)

Introduction ::Ghana




Background:


Formed from the merger of the British colony of the Gold Coast and
the Togoland trust territory, Ghana in 1957 became the first
sub-Saharan country in colonial Africa to gain its independence.
Ghana endured a long series of coups before Lt. Jerry RAWLINGS took
power in 1981 and banned political parties. After approving a new
constitution and restoring multiparty politics in 1992, RAWLINGS won
presidential elections in 1992 and 1996, but was constitutionally
prevented from running for a third term in 2000. John KUFUOR
succeeded him and was reelected in 2004. John Atta MILLS took over
as head of state in early 2009.

Economy ::Ghana




Economy - overview:


Ghana is well endowed with natural resources and agriculture
accounts for roughly one-third of GDP and employs more than half of
the workforce, mainly small landholders. The services sector
accounts for 50% of GDP. Gold and cocoa production and individual
remittances are major sources of foreign exchange. Oil production at
Ghana's offshore Jubilee field began in mid-December and is expected
to boost economic growth. Ghana signed a Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) Compact in 2006, which aims to assist in
transforming Ghana's agricultural sector. Ghana opted for debt
relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) program in
2002, and is also benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative that took effect in 2006. In 2009 Ghana signed a
three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF to
improve macroeconomic stability, private sector competitiveness,
human resource development, and good governance and civic
responsibility. Sound macro-economic management along with high
prices for gold and cocoa helped sustain GDP growth in 2008-10. In
early 2010 President John Atta MILLS targeted recovery from high
inflation and current account and budget deficits as his priorities.
