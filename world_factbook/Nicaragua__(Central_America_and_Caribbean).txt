Nicaragua  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Nicaragua




Background:


The Pacific coast of Nicaragua was settled as a Spanish colony from
Panama in the early 16th century. Independence from Spain was
declared in 1821 and the country became an independent republic in
1838. Britain occupied the Caribbean Coast in the first half of the
19th century, but gradually ceded control of the region in
subsequent decades. Violent opposition to governmental manipulation
and corruption spread to all classes by 1978 and resulted in a
short-lived civil war that brought the Marxist Sandinista guerrillas
to power in 1979. Nicaraguan aid to leftist rebels in El Salvador
caused the US to sponsor anti-Sandinista contra guerrillas through
much of the 1980s. Free elections in 1990, 1996, and 2001, saw the
Sandinistas defeated, but voting in 2006 announced the return of
former Sandinista President Daniel ORTEGA Saavedra. The 2008
municipal elections were characterized by widespread irregularities.
Nicaragua's infrastructure and economy - hard hit by the earlier
civil war and by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 - are slowly being rebuilt,
but democratic institutions face new challenges under the ORTEGA
administration.

Economy ::Nicaragua




Economy - overview:


Nicaragua, the poorest country in Central America and the second
poorest in the Hemisphere, has widespread underemployment and
poverty. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) has
been in effect since April 2006 and has expanded export
opportunities for many agricultural and manufactured goods. Textiles
and apparel account for nearly 60% of Nicaragua's exports, but
increases in the minimum wage during the ORTEGA administration will
likely erode its comparative advantage in this industry. ORTEGA's
promotion of mixed business initiatives, owned by the Nicaraguan and
Venezuelan state oil firms, together with the weak rule of law,
could undermine the investment climate for domestic and
international private firms in the near-term. Nicaragua relies on
international economic assistance to meet internal- and
external-debt financing obligations. Foreign donors have curtailed
this funding, however, in response to November 2008 electoral fraud.
Managua has an IMF extended Credit Facility program, which could
help keep the government's fiscial deficit on target during the 2011
election year and encourage transparency in the use of Venezuelan
off-budget loans and assistance. In early 2004, Nicaragua secured
some $4.5 billion in foreign debt reduction under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, however, Managua still
struggles with a high public debt burden. Nicaragua is gradually
recovering from the global economic crisis as increased exports
drove positive growth in 2010. The economy is expected to grow at a
rate of about 3% in 2011.

mobile-cellular services has improved but teledensity still lags
behind other Central American countries; fixed-line teledensity
roughly 5 per 100 persons; mobile-cellular telephone subscribership
