Saint Vincent and the Grenadines  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Saint Vincent and the Grenadines




Background:


Resistance by native Caribs prevented colonization on Saint Vincent
until 1719. Disputed between France and the United Kingdom for most
of the 18th century, the island was ceded to the latter in 1783.
Between 1960 and 1962, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was a
separate administrative unit of the Federation of the West Indies.
Autonomy was granted in 1969 and independence in 1979.

Economy ::Saint Vincent and the Grenadines




Economy - overview:


Success of the economy hinges upon seasonal variations in
agriculture, tourism, and construction activity as well as
remittance inflows. Much of the workforce is employed in banana
production and tourism, but persistent high unemployment has
prompted many to leave the islands. This lower-middle-income country
is vulnerable to natural disasters - tropical storms wiped out
substantial portions of crops in 1994, 1995, and 2002. In 2008, the
islands had more than 200,000 tourist arrivals, mostly to the
Grenadines, a drop of nearly 20% from 2007. Saint Vincent is home to
a small offshore banking sector and has moved to adopt international
regulatory standards. The government's ability to invest in social
programs and respond to external shocks is constrained by its high
public debt burden, which was over 90% of GDP at the end of 2010.
Following the global downturn, St. Vincent and the Grenadines saw an
economic decline in 2009, after slowing since 2006, when GDP growth
reached a 10-year high of nearly 7%. The GONSALVES administration is
directing government resources to infrastructure projects, including
a new international airport that is expected to be completed in 2011.
