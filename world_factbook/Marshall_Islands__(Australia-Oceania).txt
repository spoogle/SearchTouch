Marshall Islands  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Marshall Islands




Background:


After almost four decades under US administration as the easternmost
part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Marshall
Islands attained independence in 1986 under a Compact of Free
Association. Compensation claims continue as a result of US nuclear
testing on some of the atolls between 1947 and 1962. The Marshall
Islands hosts the US Army Kwajalein Atoll (USAKA) Reagan Missile
Test Site, a key installation in the US missile defense network.

Economy ::Marshall Islands




Economy - overview:


US Government assistance is the mainstay of this tiny island
economy. The Marshall Islands received more than $1 billion in aid
from the US from 1986-2002. Agricultural production, primarily
subsistence, is concentrated on small farms; the most important
commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit. Small-scale industry
is limited to handicrafts, tuna processing, and copra. The tourist
industry, now a small source of foreign exchange employing less than
10% of the labor force, remains the best hope for future added
income. The islands have few natural resources, and imports far
exceed exports. Under the terms of the Amended Compact of Free
Association, the US will provide millions of dollars per year to the
Marshall Islands (RMI) through 2023, at which time a Trust Fund made
up of US and RMI contributions will begin perpetual annual payouts.
Government downsizing, drought, a drop in construction, the decline
in tourism, and less income from the renewal of fishing vessel
licenses have held GDP growth to an average of 1% over the past
decade.
