Nigeria  (Africa)

Introduction ::Nigeria




Background:


British influence and control over what would become Nigeria and
Africa's most populous country grew through the 19th century. A
series of constitutions after World War II granted Nigeria greater
autonomy; independence came in 1960. Following nearly 16 years of
military rule, a new constitution was adopted in 1999, and a
peaceful transition to civilian government was completed. The
government continues to face the daunting task of reforming a
petroleum-based economy, whose revenues have been squandered through
corruption and mismanagement, and institutionalizing democracy. In
addition, Nigeria continues to experience longstanding ethnic and
religious tensions. Although both the 2003 and 2007 presidential
elections were marred by significant irregularities and violence,
Nigeria is currently experiencing its longest period of civilian
rule since independence. The general elections of April 2007 marked
the first civilian-to-civilian transfer of power in the country's
history. In January 2010, Nigeria assumed a nonpermanent seat on the
UN Security Council for the 2010-11 term.

Economy ::Nigeria




Economy - overview:


Oil-rich Nigeria has been hobbled by political instability,
corruption, inadequate infrastructure, and poor macroeconomic
management but in 2008 began pursuing economic reforms. Nigeria's
former military rulers failed to diversify the economy away from its
overdependence on the capital-intensive oil sector, which provides
95% of foreign exchange earnings and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. Following the signing of an IMF stand-by agreement in
August 2000, Nigeria received a debt-restructuring deal from the
Paris Club and a $1 billion credit from the IMF, both contingent on
economic reforms. Nigeria pulled out of its IMF program in April
2002, after failing to meet spending and exchange rate targets,
making it ineligible for additional debt forgiveness from the Paris
Club. In November 2005, Abuja won Paris Club approval for a
debt-relief deal that eliminated $18 billion of debt in exchange for
$12 billion in payments - a total package worth $30 billion of
Nigeria's total $37 billion external debt. Since 2008 the government
has begun to show the political will to implement the
market-oriented reforms urged by the IMF, such as modernizing the
banking system, curbing inflation by blocking excessive wage
demands, and resolving regional disputes over the distribution of
earnings from the oil industry. GDP rose strongly in 2007-10 because
of increased oil exports and high global crude prices in 2010.
President JONATHAN has pledged to continue the economic reforms of
his predecessor with emphasis on infrastructure improvements.
Infrastructure is the main impediment to growth and in August 2010
JONATHAN unveiled a power sector blueprint that includes
privatization of the state-run electricity generation and
distribution facilities. The government also is working toward
developing stronger public-private partnerships for roads. Nigeria's
financial sector was hurt by the global financial and economic
crises and the Central Bank governor has taken measures to
strengthen that sector.

general assessment: further expansion and modernization of the
fixed-line telephone network is needed; network quality remains a
problem

resulted in faster growth but subscribership remains only about 1
per 100 persons; mobile-cellular services growing rapidly, in part
responding to the shortcomings of the fixed-line network; multiple
cellular providers operate nationally with subscribership reaching
50 per 100 persons in 2009

Transnational Issues ::Nigeria




Disputes - international:


Joint Border Commission with Cameroon reviewed 2002 ICJ ruling on
the entire boundary and bilaterally resolved differences, including
June 2006 Greentree Agreement that immediately cedes sovereignty of
the Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon with a phase-out of Nigerian
control within two years while resolving patriation issues; the ICJ
ruled on an equidistance settlement of Cameroon-Equatorial
Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, but
imprecisely defined coordinates in the ICJ decision and a
sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an
island at the mouth of the Ntem River all contribute to the delay in
implementation; only Nigeria and Cameroon have heeded the Lake Chad
Commission's admonition to ratify the delimitation treaty which also
includes the Chad-Niger and Niger-Nigeria boundaries

a transit point for heroin and cocaine intended for European, East
Asian, and North American markets; consumer of amphetamines; safe
haven for Nigerian narcotraffickers operating worldwide; major
money-laundering center; massive corruption and criminal activity;
Nigeria has improved some anti-money-laundering controls, resulting
in its removal from the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF's)
Noncooperative Countries and Territories List in June 2006;
Nigeria's anti-money-laundering regime continues to be monitored by
FATF
