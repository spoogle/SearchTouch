Korea, North  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Korea, North




Background:


An independent kingdom for much of its long history, Korea was
occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese
War. Five years later, Japan formally annexed the entire peninsula.
Following World War II, Korea was split with the northern half
coming under Soviet-sponsored Communist control. After failing in
the Korean War (1950-53) to conquer the US-backed Republic of Korea
(ROK) in the southern portion by force, North Korea (DPRK), under
its founder President KIM Il Sung, adopted a policy of ostensible
diplomatic and economic "self-reliance" as a check against outside
influence. The DPRK demonized the US as the ultimate threat to its
social system through state-funded propaganda, and molded political,
economic, and military policies around the core ideological
objective of eventual unification of Korea under Pyongyang's
control. KIM's son, the current ruler KIM Jong Il, was officially
designated as his father's successor in 1980, assuming a growing
political and managerial role until the elder KIM's death in 1994.
After decades of economic mismanagement and resource misallocation,
the DPRK since the mid-1990s has relied heavily on international aid
to feed its population. North Korea's history of regional military
provocations, proliferation of military-related items, long-range
missile development, WMD programs including tests of nuclear devices
in 2006 and 2009, and massive conventional armed forces are of major
concern to the international community.

Economy ::Korea, North




Economy - overview:


North Korea, one of the world's most centrally directed and least
open economies, faces chronic economic problems. Industrial capital
stock is nearly beyond repair as a result of years of
underinvestment and shortages of spare parts. Large-scale military
spending draws off resources needed for investment and civilian
consumption. Industrial and power output have declined in parallel
from pre-1990 levels. Severe flooding in the summer of 2007
aggravated chronic food shortages caused by on-going systemic
problems, including a lack of arable land, collective farming
practices, and persistent shortages of tractors and fuel.
Large-scale international food aid deliveries have allowed the
people of North Korea to escape widespread starvation since famine
threatened in 1995, but the population continues to suffer from
prolonged malnutrition and poor living conditions. Since 2002, the
government has allowed private "farmers' markets" to begin selling a
wider range of goods. It also permitted some private farming - on an
experimental basis - in an effort to boost agricultural output. In
October 2005, the government tried to reverse some of these policies
by forbidding private sales of grains and reinstituting a
centralized food rationing system. By December 2005, the government
terminated most international humanitarian assistance operations in
North Korea (calling instead for developmental assistance only) and
restricted the activities of remaining international and
non-governmental aid organizations. In mid-2008, North Korea began
receiving food aid under a US program to deliver 500,000 metric tons
of food via the World Food Program and US nongovernmental
organizations; but Pyongyang stopped accepting the aid in March
2009. In December 2009, North Korea carried out a redenomination of
its currency, capping the amount of North Korean won that could be
exchanged for the new notes, and limiting the exchange to a one-week
window. A concurrent crackdown on markets and foreign currency use
yielded severe shortages and inflation, forcing Pyongyang to ease
the restrictions by February 2010. Nevertheless, firm political
control remains the Communist government's overriding concern, which
likely will inhibit changes to North Korea's current economic system.

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: North Korea is a source country for men, women,
and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and
commercial sexual exploitation; the most common form of trafficking
involves North Korean women and girls who cross the border into
China voluntarily; additionally, North Korean women and girls are
lured out of North Korea to escape poor social and economic
conditions by the promise of food, jobs, and freedom, only to be
forced into prostitution, marriage, or exploitative labor
arrangements once in China

tier rating: Tier 3 - North Korea does not fully comply with minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
significant efforts to do so; the government does not acknowledge
the existence of human rights abuses in the country or recognize
trafficking, either within the country or transnationally; North
Korea has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)



Illicit drugs:


for years, from the 1970s into the 2000s, citizens of the Democratic
People's Republic of (North) Korea (DPRK), many of them diplomatic
employees of the government, were apprehended abroad while
trafficking in narcotics, including two in Turkey in December 2004;
police investigations in Taiwan and Japan in recent years have
linked North Korea to large illicit shipments of heroin and
methamphetamine, including an attempt by the North Korean merchant
ship Pong Su to deliver 150 kg of heroin to Australia in April 2003
