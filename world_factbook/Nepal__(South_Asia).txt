Introduction ::Nepal




Background:


In 1951, the Nepalese monarch ended the century-old system of rule
by hereditary premiers and instituted a cabinet system of
government. Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy
within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. An insurgency led
by Maoist extremists broke out in 1996. The ensuing ten-year civil
war between insurgents and government forces witnessed the
dissolution of the cabinet and parliament and assumption of absolute
power by the king. Several weeks of mass protests in April 2006 were
followed by several months of peace negotiations between the Maoists
and government officials, and culminated in a November 2006 peace
accord and the promulgation of an interim constitution. Following a
nation-wide election in April 2008, the newly formed Constituent
Assembly declared Nepal a federal democratic republic and abolished
the monarchy at its first meeting the following month. The
Constituent Assembly elected the country's first president in July.
The Maoists, who received a plurality of votes in the Constituent
Assembly election, formed a coalition government in August 2008, but
resigned in May 2009 after the president overruled a decision to
fire the chief of the army staff. The Communist Party of
Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist and the Nepali Congress party then
formed a new coalition government with several smaller parties. In
June 2010, the prime minister resigned but, as of December 2010,
continued to lead a caretaker government while the parties debate
who should lead the next government. Disagreements among the
political parties over issues such as the future of former Maoist
combatants has hindered the drafting of a new constitution -- due in
May 2011 -- and the formal conclusion of the peace process.

Flag description:


red with a blue border around the unique shape of two overlapping
right triangles; the smaller, upper triangle bears a white stylized
moon and the larger, lower triangle displays a white 12-pointed sun;
the color red represents the rhododendron (Nepal's national flower)
and is a sign of victory and bravery, the blue border signifies
peace and harmony; the two right triangles are a combination of two
single pennons (pennants) that originally symbolized the Himalaya
Mountains while their charges represented the families of the king
(upper) and the prime minister, but today they are understood to
denote Hinduism and Buddhism, the country's two main religions; the
moon represents the serenity of the Nepalese people and the shade
and cool weather in the Himalayas, while the sun depicts the heat
and higher temperatures of the lower parts of Nepal; the moon and
the sun are also said to express the hope that the nation will
endure as long as these heavenly bodies

rectangular or square

Economy ::Nepal




Economy - overview:


Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the
world, with almost one-quarter of its population living below the
poverty line. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing
a livelihood for three-fourths of the population and accounting for
about one-third of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the
processing of agricultural products, including pulses, jute,
sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Nepal has considerable scope for
exploiting its potential in hydropower, with an estimated 42,000 MW
of feasible capacity, but political instability hampers foreign
investment. Additional challenges to Nepal's growth include its
landlocked geographic location, civil strife and labor unrest, and
its susceptibility to natural disaster.
