Guyana  (South America)

Introduction ::Guyana




Background:


Originally a Dutch colony in the 17th century, by 1815 Guyana had
become a British possession. The abolition of slavery led to black
settlement of urban areas and the importation of indentured servants
from India to work the sugar plantations. This ethnocultural divide
has persisted and has led to turbulent politics. Guyana achieved
independence from the UK in 1966, and since then it has been ruled
mostly by socialist-oriented governments. In 1992, Cheddi JAGAN was
elected president in what is considered the country's first free and
fair election since independence. After his death five years later,
his wife, Janet JAGAN, became president but resigned in 1999 due to
poor health. Her successor, Bharrat JAGDEO, was reelected in 2001
and again in 2006.

Economy ::Guyana




Economy - overview:


The Guyanese economy exhibited moderate economic growth in recent
years and is based largely on agriculture and extractive industries.
The economy is heavily dependent upon the export of six commodities
- sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice - which represent
nearly 60% of the country's GDP and are highly susceptible to
adverse weather conditions and fluctuations in commodity prices.
Guyana's entrance into the Caricom Single Market and Economy (CSME)
in January 2006 has broadened the country's export market, primarily
in the raw materials sector. Economic recovery since a 2005
flood-related contraction was buoyed by increases in remittances and
foreign direct investment in the sugar and rice industries as well
as the mining sector. Chronic problems include a shortage of skilled
labor and a deficient infrastructure. The government is juggling a
sizable external debt against the urgent need for expanded public
investment. In March 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank,
Guyana's principal donor, canceled Guyana's nearly $470 million
debt, equivalent to nearly 48% of GDP, which along with other Highly
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) debt forgiveness brought the
debt-to-GDP ratio down from 183% in 2006 to 120% in 2007. Guyana
became heavily indebted as a result of the inward-looking, state-led
development model pursued in the 1970s and 1980s. Growth slowed in
2009-10 as a result of the world recession. The slowdown in the
domestic economy and lower import costs helped to narrow the
country's current account deficit, despite generally lower earnings
from exports.

Transnational Issues ::Guyana




Disputes - international:


all of the area west of the Essequibo River is claimed by Venezuela
preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has
expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before
UNCLOS that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela
extends into their waters; Suriname claims a triangle of land
between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a historic dispute over
the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks arbitration under
provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to
resolve the long-standing dispute with Suriname over the axis of the
territorial sea boundary in potentially oil-rich waters



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Guyana is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; most trafficking
appears to take place in remote mining camps in the country's
interior; some women and girls are trafficked from northern Brazil;
reporting from other nations suggests Guyanese women and girls are
trafficked for sexual exploitation to neighboring countries and
Guyanese men and boys are subject to labor exploitation in
construction and agriculture; trafficking victims from Suriname,
Brazil, and Venezuela transit Guyana en route to Caribbean
destinations

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
Guyana is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence
of increasing efforts to combat trafficking, particularly in the
area of law enforcement actions against trafficking offenders; the
government has yet to produce an anti-trafficking conviction under
the comprehensive Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which
became law in 2005; the government operates no shelters for
trafficking victims, but did include limited funding for
anti-trafficking NGOs in its 2008 budget; the government did not
make any effort to reduce demand for commercial sex acts during 2007
(2008)



Illicit drugs:


transshipment point for narcotics from South America - primarily
Venezuela - to Europe and the US; producer of cannabis; rising money
laundering related to drug trafficking and human smuggling
