Belize  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Belize




Background:


Belize was the site of several Mayan city states until their decline
at the end of the first millennium A.D. The British and Spanish
disputed the region in the 17th and 18th centuries; it formally
became the colony of British Honduras in 1854. Territorial disputes
between the UK and Guatemala delayed the independence of Belize
until 1981. Guatemala refused to recognize the new nation until 1992
and the two countries are involved in an ongoing border dispute.
Guatemala and Belize plan to hold a simultaneous referendum to
determine if this dispute will go before the International Court of
Justice at The Hague, though they have not yet set a date. Tourism
has become the mainstay of the economy. Current concerns include the
country's heavy foreign debt burden, high unemployment, growing
involvement in the South American drug trade, high crime rates, and
increasing incidences of HIV/AIDS.

Economy ::Belize




Economy - overview:


In this small, essentially private-enterprise economy, tourism is
the number one foreign exchange earner followed by exports of marine
products, citrus, cane sugar, bananas, and garments. The
government's expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, initiated in
September 1998, led to sturdy GDP growth averaging nearly 4% in
1999-2007, though growth slipped to 3.8% in 2008, 0% in 2009, and
1.5% in 2010 as a result of the global slowdown, natural disasters,
and the drop in the price of oil. Oil discoveries in 2006 bolstered
economic growth. Exploration efforts continue and production
increased a small amount in 2009. Major concerns continue to be the
sizable trade deficit and heavy foreign debt burden. In February
2007, the government restructured nearly all of its public external
commercial debt, which helped reduce interest payments and relieved
some of the country's liquidity concerns. A key objective remains
the reduction of poverty and inequality with the help of
international donors.

Transnational Issues ::Belize




Disputes - international:


OAS-initiated Agreement on the Framework for Negotiations and
Confidence Building Measures saw cooperation in repatriation of
Guatemalan squatters and other areas, but Guatemalan land and
maritime claims in Belize and the Caribbean Sea remain unresolved;
the Line of Adjacency created under the 2002 Differendum serves in
lieu of the contiguous international boundary to control squatting
in the sparsely inhabited rain forests of Belize's border region;
Honduras claims Belizean-administered Sapodilla Cays in its
constitution but agreed to a joint ecological park under the
Differendum



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Belize is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; the most common
form of trafficking in Belize is the internal sex trafficking of
minors; some Central American men, women, and children, particularly
from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, migrate voluntarily to
Belize in search of work but are subsequently subjected to
conditions of forced labor or forced prostitution

tier rating: Belize is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it does
not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;
despite efforts to raise public awareness of human trafficking and
provide protection services for trafficking victims, the government
did not show evidence of progress in convicting and sentencing
trafficking offenders last year (2009)



Illicit drugs:


transshipment point for cocaine; small-scale illicit producer of
cannabis, primarily for local consumption; offshore sector
money-laundering activity related to narcotics trafficking and other
crimes (2008)
