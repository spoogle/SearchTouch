Bolivia  (South America)

Introduction ::Bolivia




Background:


Bolivia, named after independence fighter Simon BOLIVAR, broke away
from Spanish rule in 1825; much of its subsequent history has
consisted of a series of nearly 200 coups and countercoups.
Democratic civilian rule was established in 1982, but leaders have
faced difficult problems of deep-seated poverty, social unrest, and
illegal drug production. In December 2005, Bolivians elected
Movement Toward Socialism leader Evo MORALES president - by the
widest margin of any leader since the restoration of civilian rule
in 1982 - after he ran on a promise to change the country's
traditional political class and empower the nation's poor,
indigenous majority. However, since taking office, his controversial
strategies have exacerbated racial and economic tensions between the
Amerindian populations of the Andean west and the non-indigenous
communities of the eastern lowlands. In December 2009, President
MORALES easily won reelection, and his party took control of the
legislative branch of the government, which will allow him to
continue his process of change.

Economy ::Bolivia




Economy - overview:


Bolivia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Latin
America. Following a disastrous economic crisis during the early
1980s, reforms spurred private investment, stimulated economic
growth, and cut poverty rates in the 1990s. The period 2003-05 was
characterized by political instability, racial tensions, and violent
protests against plans - subsequently abandoned - to export
Bolivia's newly discovered natural gas reserves to large northern
hemisphere markets. In 2005, the government passed a controversial
hydrocarbons law that imposed significantly higher royalties and
required foreign firms then operating under risk-sharing contracts
to surrender all production to the state energy company in exchange
for a predetermined service fee. After higher prices for mining and
hydrocarbons exports produced a fiscal surplus in 2008, the global
recession in 2009 slowed growth. A decline in commodity prices that
began in late 2008, a lack of foreign investment in the mining and
hydrocarbon sectors, a poor infrastructure, and the suspension of
trade benefits with the United States will pose challenges for the
Bolivian economy.
