Moldova  (Europe)

Introduction ::Moldova




Background:


Part of Romania during the interwar period, Moldova was incorporated
into the Soviet Union at the close of World War II. Although the
country has been independent from the USSR since 1991, Russian
forces have remained on Moldovan territory east of the Dniester
River supporting the Slavic majority population, mostly Ukrainians
and Russians, who have proclaimed a "Transnistria" republic. One of
the poorest nations in Europe, Moldova became the first former
Soviet state to elect a Communist, Vladimir VORONIN, as its
president in 2001. VORONIN served as Moldova's president until he
resigned in September 2009, following the opposition's gain of a
narrow majority in July parliamentary elections and the Communist
Party's (PCRM) subsequent inability to attract the three-fifths of
parliamentary votes required to elect a president. Moldova's four
opposition parties formed a new coalition, the Alliance for European
Integration (AEI), which acted as Moldova's governing coalition
until parliamentary elections were held in November 2010 and a new
governing coalition could be formed. Moldova experienced significant
political uncertainty in 2009 and 2010, holding three general
elections (in April 2009, July 2009, and November 2010) and four
presidential ballots in parliament, all of which failed to secure a
president.

Economy ::Moldova




Economy - overview:


Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe despite
recent progress from its small economic base. It enjoys a favorable
climate and good farmland but has no major mineral deposits. As a
result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture, featuring
fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import almost
all of its energy supplies. Moldova's dependence on Russian energy
was underscored at the end of 2005, when a Russian-owned electrical
station in Moldova's separatist Transnistria region cut off power to
Moldova and Russia's Gazprom cut off natural gas in disputes over
pricing. In January 2009, gas supplies were cut during a dispute
between Russia and Ukraine. Russia's decision to ban Moldovan wine
and agricultural products, coupled with its decision to double the
price Moldova paid for Russian natural gas, have hurt growth. The
onset of the global financial crisis and poor economic conditions in
Moldova's main foreign markets, caused GDP to fall 6.5% in 2009.
Unemployment almost doubled and inflation disappeared - at -0.1%, a
record low. Moldova's IMF agreement expired in May 2009. In fall
2009, the IMF allocated $186 million to Moldova to cover its
immediate budgetary needs, and the government signed an new
agreement with the IMF in January 2010 for a program worth $574
million. In 2010, an upturn in the world economy boosted GDP growth
to 3.1% and inflation to 7.3%. Economic reforms have been slow
because of corruption and strong political forces backing government
controls. Nevertheless, the government's primary goal of EU
integration has resulted in some market-oriented progress. The
granting of EU trade preferences and increased exports to Russia
will encourage higher growth rates, but the agreements are unlikely
to serve as a panacea, given the extent to which export success
depends on higher quality standards and other factors. The economy
has made a modest recovery, but remains vulnerable to political
uncertainty, weak administrative capacity, vested bureaucratic
interests, higher fuel prices, poor agricultural weather, and the
skepticism of foreign investors as well as the presence of an
illegal separatist regime in Moldova's Transnistria region.

Transnational Issues ::Moldova




Disputes - international:


Moldova and Ukraine operate joint customs posts to monitor the
transit of people and commodities through Moldova's break-away
Transnistria region, which remains under OSCE supervision



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Moldova is a major source and, to a lesser
extent, a transit country for women and girls trafficked for the
purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; Moldovan women are
trafficked to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe;
girls and young women are trafficked within the country from rural
areas to Chisinau; children are also trafficked to neighboring
countries for forced labor and begging; labor trafficking of men to
work in the construction, agriculture, and service sectors of Russia
is increasingly a problem; according to an ILO report, Moldova's
national Bureau of Statistics estimated that there were likely over
25,000 Moldovan victims of trafficking for forced labor in 2008

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - The Government of Moldova does not
fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;
despite initial efforts to combat trafficking-related complicity
since the government's reassessment on the Tier 2 Watch List in
September 2008, and increased victim assistance, the government did
not demonstrate sufficiently meaningful efforts to curb
trafficking-related corruption, which is a government-acknowledged
problem in Moldova; the government improved victim protection
efforts, deployed more law-enforcement officers in the effort and
contributed direct financial assistance toward victim protection and
assistance for the first time (2010)



Illicit drugs:


limited cultivation of opium poppy and cannabis, mostly for CIS
consumption; transshipment point for illicit drugs from Southwest
Asia via Central Asia to Russia, Western Europe, and possibly the
US; widespread crime and underground economic activity
