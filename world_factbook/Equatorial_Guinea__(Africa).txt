Equatorial Guinea  (Africa)

Introduction ::Equatorial Guinea




Background:


Equatorial Guinea gained independence in 1968 after 190 years of
Spanish rule. This tiny country, composed of a mainland portion plus
five inhabited islands, is one of the smallest on the African
continent. President Teodoro OBIANG NGUEMA MBASOGO has ruled the
country since 1979 when he seized power in a coup. Although
nominally a constitutional democracy since 1991, the 1996, 2002, and
2009 presidential elections - as well as the 1999 and 2004
legislative elections - were widely seen as flawed. The president
exerts almost total control over the political system and has
discouraged political opposition. Equatorial Guinea has experienced
rapid economic growth due to the discovery of large offshore oil
reserves, and in the last decade has become Sub-Saharan Africa's
third largest oil exporter. Despite the country's economic windfall
from oil production resulting in a massive increase in government
revenue in recent years, there have been few improvements in the
population's living standards.

Economy ::Equatorial Guinea




Economy - overview:


The discovery and exploitation of large oil reserves have
contributed to dramatic economic growth but fluctuating oil prices
have produced huge swings in GDP growth in recent years. Forestry,
farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence
farming is the dominate form of livelihood. Although
pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under
successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
growth (the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil
revenue into agriculture). A number of aid programs sponsored by the
World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of
corruption and mismanagement. Government officials and their family
members own most businesses, but corruption is rampant. Undeveloped
natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium,
and alluvial gold. Growth remained strong in 2008, led by oil, but
dropped in 2009-10, as the price of oil fell.

Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of
Guinea, but a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an
island at the mouth of the Ntem River and imprecisely defined
maritime coordinates in the ICJ decision delay final delimitation;
UN urges Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to resolve the sovereignty
dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane and lesser islands and to create a
maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Equatorial Guinea is primarily a destination
country for children trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and
possibly for the purpose of sexual exploitation; children have been
trafficked from nearby countries for domestic servitude, market
labor, ambulant vending, and possibly sexual exploitation; women may
also be trafficked to Equatorial Guinea from Cameroon, Benin, other
neighboring countries, and China for sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Equatorial Guinea is on the Tier 2
Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
to eliminate trafficking, particularly in the areas of prosecuting
and convicting trafficking offenders and failing to formalize
mechanisms to provide assistance to victims; although the government
made some effort to enforce laws against child labor exploitation,
it failed to report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions in
2007; the government continued to lack shelters or formal procedures
for providing care to victims (2008)
