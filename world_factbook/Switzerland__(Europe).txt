Switzerland  (Europe)

Introduction ::Switzerland




Background:


The Swiss Confederation was founded in 1291 as a defensive alliance
among three cantons. In succeeding years, other localities joined
the original three. The Swiss Confederation secured its independence
from the Holy Roman Empire in 1499. A constitution of 1848,
subsequently modified in 1874, replaced the confederation with a
centralized federal government. Switzerland's sovereignty and
neutrality have long been honored by the major European powers, and
the country was not involved in either of the two World Wars. The
political and economic integration of Europe over the past half
century, as well as Switzerland's role in many UN and international
organizations, has strengthened Switzerland's ties with its
neighbors. However, the country did not officially become a UN
member until 2002. Switzerland remains active in many UN and
international organizations but retains a strong commitment to
neutrality.

Economy ::Switzerland




Economy - overview:


Switzerland is a peaceful, prosperous, and modern market economy
with low unemployment, a highly skilled labor force, and a per
capita GDP among the highest in the world. Switzerland's economy
benefits from a highly developed service sector, led by financial
services, and a manufacturing industry that specializes in
high-technology, knowledge-based production. The Swiss have brought
their economic practices largely into conformity with the EU's, in
order to enhance their international competitiveness, but some trade
protectionism remains, particularly for its small agricultural
sector. The global financial crisis and resulting economic downturn
put Switzerland in a recession in 2009 as global export demand
stalled. The Swiss National Bank during this period effectively
implemented a zero-interest rate policy in a bid to boost the
economy and prevent appreciation of the franc. Switzerland's economy
grew 2.8% in 2010, when Bern implemented a third fiscal stimulus
program, but its prized banking sector has recently faced
significant challenges. The country's largest banks suffered sizable
losses in 2008-09, leading its largest bank to accept a government
rescue deal in late 2008. Switzerland has also come under increasing
pressure from individual neighboring countries, the EU, the US, and
international institutions to reform its banking secrecy laws.
Consequently, the government agreed to conform to OECD regulations
on administrative assistance in tax matters, including tax evasion.
The government has renegotiated its double taxation agreements with
numerous countries, including the US, to incorporate the OECD
standard, and it is working with Germany and the UK to resolve
outsanding issues, particularly the possibility of imposing taxes on
bank deposits held by foreigners. Parliament passed the first five
double-taxation agreements, including that with the US, in March
2010, but the agreements are subject to public referendum. In 2009,
Swiss financial regulators ordered the country's largest bank to
reveal at Washington's behest the names of US account-holders
suspected of using the bank to commit tax fraud. These steps will
have a lasting impact on Switzerland's long history of bank secrecy.
