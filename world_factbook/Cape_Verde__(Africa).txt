Cape Verde  (Africa)

Introduction ::Cape Verde




Background:


The uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the
Portuguese in the 15th century; Cape Verde subsequently became a
trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and
resupply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Following
independence in 1975, and a tentative interest in unification with
Guinea-Bissau, a one-party system was established and maintained
until multi-party elections were held in 1990. Cape Verde continues
to exhibit one of Africa's most stable democratic governments.
Repeated droughts during the second half of the 20th century caused
significant hardship and prompted heavy emigration. As a result,
Cape Verde's expatriate population is greater than its domestic one.
Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents.

Economy ::Cape Verde




Economy - overview:


This island economy suffers from a poor natural resource base,
including serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term
drought and poor soil for agriculture on several of the islands. The
economy is service oriented with commerce, transport, tourism, and
public services accounting for about three-fourths of GDP. Although
nearly 70% of the population lives in rural areas, the share of food
production in GDP is low. About 82% of food must be imported. The
fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited.
Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit financed by foreign
aid and remittances from its large pool of emigrants; remittances
supplement GDP by more than 20%. Despite the lack of resources,
sound economic management has produced steadily improving incomes.
Continued economic reforms are aimed at developing the private
sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.
Future prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the
encouragement of tourism, remittances, and the momentum of the
government's development program. Cape Verde became a member of the
WTO in July 2008.
