Cook Islands  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Cook Islands




Background:


Named after Captain COOK, who sighted them in 1770, the islands
became a British protectorate in 1888. By 1900, administrative
control was transferred to New Zealand; in 1965, residents chose
self-government in free association with New Zealand. The emigration
of skilled workers to New Zealand and government deficits are
continuing problems.

Economy ::Cook Islands




Economy - overview:


Like many other South Pacific island nations, the Cook Islands'
economic development is hindered by the isolation of the country
from foreign markets, the limited size of domestic markets, lack of
natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and
inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture, employing more than
one-quarter of the working population, provides the economic base
with major exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Black pearls
are the Cook Islands' leading export. Manufacturing activities are
limited to fruit processing, clothing, and handicrafts. Trade
deficits are offset by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid
overwhelmingly from New Zealand. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country
lived beyond its means, maintaining a bloated public service and
accumulating a large foreign debt. Subsequent reforms, including the
sale of state assets, the strengthening of economic management, the
encouragement of tourism, and a debt restructuring agreement, have
rekindled investment and growth.
