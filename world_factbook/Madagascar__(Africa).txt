Introduction ::Madagascar




Background:


Formerly an independent kingdom, Madagascar became a French colony
in 1896 but regained independence in 1960. During 1992-93, free
presidential and National Assembly elections were held ending 17
years of single-party rule. In 1997, in the second presidential
race, Didier RATSIRAKA, the leader during the 1970s and 1980s, was
returned to the presidency. The 2001 presidential election was
contested between the followers of Didier RATSIRAKA and Marc
RAVALOMANANA, nearly causing secession of half of the country. In
April 2002, the High Constitutional Court announced RAVALOMANANA the
winner. RAVALOMANANA achieved a second term following a landslide
victory in the generally free and fair presidential elections of
2006. In early 2009, protests over increasing restrictions on
opposition press and activities resulted in RAVALOMANANA stepping
down and the presidency was conferred to the mayor of Antananarivo,
Andry RAJOELINA. Following negotiations in July and August of 2009,
a power-sharing agreement with a 15-month transitional period was
established, but has not yet been implemented.

Economy ::Madagascar




Economy - overview:


After discarding socialist economic policies in the mid-1990s,
Madagascar followed a World Bank- and IMF-led policy of
privatization and liberalization that has been undermined since the
start of the political crisis. This strategy placed the country on a
slow and steady growth path from an extremely low level.
Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is a mainstay of the
economy, accounting for more than one-fourth of GDP and employing
80% of the population. Exports of apparel have boomed in recent
years primarily due to duty-free access to the US. However,
Madagascar's failure to comply with the requirements of the African
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) led to the termination of the
country's duty-free access in January 2010. Deforestation and
erosion, aggravated by the use of firewood as the primary source of
fuel, are serious concerns. Former President RAVALOMANANA worked
aggressively to revive the economy following the 2002 political
crisis, which triggered a 12% drop in GDP that year. The current
political crisis which began in early 2009 has dealt additional
blows to the economy. Tourism dropped more than 50% in 2009,
compared with the previous year, and many investors are wary of
entering the uncertain investment environment.
