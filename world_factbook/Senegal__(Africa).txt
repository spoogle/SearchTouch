Senegal  (Africa)

Introduction ::Senegal




Background:


The French colonies of Senegal and the French Sudan were merged in
1959 and granted their independence as the Mali Federation in 1960.
The union broke up after only a few months. Senegal joined with The
Gambia to form the nominal confederation of Senegambia in 1982. The
envisaged integration of the two countries was never carried out,
and the union was dissolved in 1989. The Movement of Democratic
Forces in the Casamance (MFDC) has led a low-level separatist
insurgency in southern Senegal since the 1980s, and several peace
deals have failed to resolve the conflict. Nevertheless, Senegal
remains one of the most stable democracies in Africa. Senegal was
ruled by a Socialist Party for 40 years until current President
Abdoulaye WADE was elected in 2000. He was reelected in February
2007 and has amended Senegal's constitution over a dozen times to
increase executive power and to weaken the opposition, part of the
President's increasingly autocratic governing style. Senegal has a
long history of participating in international peacekeeping and
regional mediation.

Economy ::Senegal




Economy - overview:


Senegal relies heavily on donor assistance. The country's key export
industries are phosphate mining, fertilizer production, and
commercial fishing. The country is also working on iron ore and oil
exploration projects. In January 1994, Senegal undertook a bold and
ambitious economic reform program with the support of the
international donor community. Government price controls and
subsidies have been steadily dismantled. After seeing its economy
contract by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal made an important turnaround,
thanks to the reform program, with real growth in GDP averaging over
5% annually during 1995-2008. Annual inflation had been pushed down
to the single digits. The country was adversely affected by the
global economic downturn in 2009 and GDP growth fell below 2%. As a
member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),
Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a
unified external tariff and a more stable monetary policy. High
unemployment, however, continues to prompt illegal migrants to flee
Senegal in search of better job opportunities in Europe. Under the
IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt relief program,
Senegal benefited from eradication of two-thirds of its bilateral,
multilateral, and private-sector debt. In 2007, Senegal and the IMF
agreed to a new, non-disbursing, Policy Support Initiative program
which was completed in 2010. Senegal received its first disbursement
from the $540 million Millennium Challenge Account compact it signed
in September 2009 for infrastructure and agriculture development. In
2010, the Senegalese people protested against frequent power cuts.
The government pledged to expand capacity by 2012 and to promote
renewable energy but until Senegal has more capacity, more protests
are likely and economic activity will be hindered. During the year,
bakers protested government price controls on bread. Foreign
investment in Senegal is constrained by Senegal's business
environment, which has slipped in recent years, and by perceptions
of corruption.
