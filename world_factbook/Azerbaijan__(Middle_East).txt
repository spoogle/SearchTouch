Azerbaijan  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Azerbaijan




Background:


Azerbaijan - a nation with a majority-Turkic and majority-Muslim
population - was briefly independent from 1918 to 1920; it regained
its independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its
conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily
Armenian-populated region that Moscow recognized as part of Soviet
Azerbaijan in the 1920s after Armenia and Azerbaijan disputed the
status of the territory. Armenia and Azerbaijan began fighting over
the area in 1988; the struggle escalated after both countries
attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By May 1994,
when a cease-fire took hold, ethnic Armenian forces held not only
Nagorno-Karabakh but also seven surrounding provinces in the
territory of Azerbaijan. Corruption in the country is ubiquitous,
and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a
2009 referendum, has been accused of authoritarianism. Although the
poverty rate has been reduced in recent years due to revenue from
oil production, the promise of widespread wealth resulting from the
continued development of Azerbaijan's energy sector remains largely
unfulfilled.

water: 3,971 sq km

note: includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the
Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by
Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991



Area - comparative:


slightly smaller than Maine



Land boundaries:


total: 2,013 km

border countries: Armenia (with Azerbaijan-proper) 566 km, Armenia
(with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan exclave) 221 km, Georgia 322 km, Iran
(with Azerbaijan-proper) 432 km, Iran (with Azerbaijan-Naxcivan
exclave) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 9 km



Coastline:


0 km (landlocked); note - Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (713 km)



Maritime claims:


none (landlocked)



Climate:


dry, semiarid steppe



Terrain:


large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of it below
sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag
Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi
(Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea



Elevation extremes:


lowest point: Caspian Sea -28 m

Environment - current issues:


local scientists consider the Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula)
(including Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the
ecologically most devastated area in the world because of severe
air, soil, and water pollution; soil pollution results from oil
spills, from the use of DDT pesticide, and from toxic defoliants
used in the production of cotton

Economy ::Azerbaijan




Economy - overview:


Azerbaijan's high economic growth during 2006-08 was attributable to
large and growing oil exports, but some non-export sectors also
featured double-digit growth, spurred by growth in the construction,
banking, and real estate sectors. In 2009, economic growth remained
above 9% even as oil prices moderated and growth in the construction
sector cooled. In 2010, economic growth slowed to approximately
3.7%, although the impact of the global financial crisis was less
severe than in many other countries in the region. The current
global economic slowdown presents some challenges for the
Azerbaijani economy as oil prices remain below their mid-2008 highs,
highlighting Azerbaijan's reliance on energy exports and lackluster
attempts to diversify its economy. Azerbaijan's oil production
increased dramatically in 1997, when Azerbaijan signed the first
production-sharing arrangement (PSA) with the Azerbaijan
International Operating Company. Oil exports through the
Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline remain the main economic driver while
efforts to boost Azerbaijan's gas production are underway. However,
Azerbaijan has made only limited progress on instituting
market-based economic reforms. Pervasive public and private sector
corruption and structural economic inefficiencies remain a drag on
long-term growth, particularly in non-energy sectors. Several other
obstacles impede Azerbaijan's economic progress: the need for
stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector and the
continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining
in importance, while trade is building with Turkey and the nations
of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the
location of new oil and gas pipelines in the region, and
Azerbaijan's ability to manage its energy wealth to promote
sustainable growth in non-energy sectors of the economy and spur
employment.

general assessment: requires considerable expansion and

telecom services are controlled by a state-owned telecommunications
monopoly and growth has been stagnant; more competition exists in
the mobile-cellular market with four providers in 2009

domestic: teledensity of 17 fixed lines per 100 persons;
mobile-cellular teledensity has increased and is rapidly approaching
100 telephones per 100 persons; satellite service connects Baku to a
modern switch in its exclave of Nakhchivan

Transnational Issues ::Azerbaijan




Disputes - international:


Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in Nagorno-Karabakh
and since the early 1990s has militarily occupied 16% of Azerbaijan;
over 800,000 mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis were driven from the
occupied lands and Armenia; about 230,000 ethnic Armenians were
driven from their homes in Azerbaijan into Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh; Azerbaijan seeks transit route through Armenia to
connect to Naxcivan exclave; Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continues to mediate dispute;
Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia have ratified Caspian seabed
delimitation treaties based on equidistance, while Iran continues to
insist on an even one-fifth allocation and challenges Azerbaijan's
hydrocarbon exploration in disputed waters; bilateral talks continue
with Turkmenistan on dividing the seabed and contested oilfields in
the middle of the Caspian; Azerbaijan and Georgia continue to
discuss the alignment of their boundary at certain crossing areas



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 2,400 (Russia)

IDPs: 580,000-690,000 (conflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh)
(2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Azerbaijan is primarily a source and transit
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; women and some
children from Azerbaijan are trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for
the purpose of sexual exploitation; men and boys are trafficked to
Russia for the purpose of forced labor; Azerbaijan serves as a
transit country for victims from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan,
and Moldova trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Azerbaijan is on the Tier 2 Watch
List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat trafficking in persons, particularly efforts to investigate,
prosecute, and punish traffickers; to address complicity among law
enforcement personnel; and to adequately identify and protect
victims in Azerbaijan; the government has yet to develop a
much-needed mechanism to identify potential trafficking victims and
refer them to safety and care; poor treatment of trafficking victims
in courtrooms continues to be a problem (2008)



Illicit drugs:


limited illicit cultivation of cannabis and opium poppy, mostly for
CIS consumption; small government eradication program; transit point
for Southwest Asian opiates bound for Russia and to a lesser extent
the rest of Europe
