Benin  (Africa)

Introduction ::Benin




Background:


Present day Benin was the site of Dahomey, a prominent West African
kingdom that rose in the 15th century. The territory became a French
Colony in 1872 and achieved independence on 1 August 1960, as the
Republic of Benin. A succession of military governments ended in
1972 with the rise to power of Mathieu KEREKOU and the establishment
of a government based on Marxist-Leninist principles. A move to
representative government began in 1989. Two years later, free
elections ushered in former Prime Minister Nicephore SOGLO as
president, marking the first successful transfer of power in Africa
from a dictatorship to a democracy. KEREKOU was returned to power by
elections held in 1996 and 2001, though some irregularities were
alleged. KEREKOU stepped down at the end of his second term in 2006
and was succeeded by Thomas YAYI Boni, a political outsider and
independent. YAYI has begun a high profile fight against corruption
and has strongly promoted accelerating Benin's economic growth.

Economy ::Benin




Economy - overview:


The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade.
Growth in real output had averaged about 4% before the global
recession, but fell to 2.5% in 2009 and 3% in 2010. Inflation has
subsided over the past several years. In order to raise growth,
Benin plans to attract more foreign investment, place more emphasis
on tourism, facilitate the development of new food processing
systems and agricultural products, and encourage new information and
communication technology. Specific projects to improve the business
climate by reforms to the land tenure system, the commercial justice
system, and the financial sector were included in Benin's $307
million Millennium Challenge Account grant signed in February 2006.
The 2001 privatization policy continues in telecommunications,
water, electricity, and agriculture. As result of these reforms,
Benin has become the most competitive country in the West African
Economic and Monetary Union, according to the World Economic Forum.
The Paris Club and bilateral creditors have eased the external debt
situation, with Benin benefiting from a G-8 debt reduction announced
in July 2005, while pressing for more rapid structural reforms. An
insufficient electrical supply continues to adversely affect Benin's
economic growth though the government recently has taken steps to
increase domestic power production.
