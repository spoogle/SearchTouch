  Preliminary statement

European Union
  The evolution of the European Union (EU) from a
  regional economic agreement among six neighboring states in 1951 to
  today's supranational organization of 27 countries across the
  European continent stands as an unprecedented phenomenon in the
  annals of history. Dynastic unions for territorial consolidation
  were long the norm in Europe. On a few occasions even country-level
  unions were arranged - the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and the
  Austro-Hungarian Empire were examples - but for such a large number
  of nation-states to cede some of their sovereignty to an overarching
  entity is truly unique.
  Although the EU is not a federation in the strict sense, it is far
  more than a free-trade association such as ASEAN, NAFTA, or
  Mercosur, and it has many of the attributes associated with
  independent nations: its own flag, anthem, founding date, and
  currency, as well as an incipient common foreign and security policy
  in its dealings with other nations.
  In the future, many of these nation-like characteristics are likely
  to be expanded. Thus, inclusion of basic intelligence on the EU has
  been deemed appropriate as a new, separate entity in The World
  Factbook. However, because of the EU's special status, this
  description is placed after the regular country entries.
