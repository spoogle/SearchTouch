Aruba  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Aruba




Background:


Discovered and claimed for Spain in 1499, Aruba was acquired by the
Dutch in 1636. The island's economy has been dominated by three main
industries. A 19th century gold rush was followed by prosperity
brought on by the opening in 1924 of an oil refinery. The last
decades of the 20th century saw a boom in the tourism industry.
Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986 and became a
separate, autonomous member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
Movement toward full independence was halted at Aruba's request in
1990.

Economy ::Aruba




Economy - overview:


Tourism is the mainstay of the small open Aruban economy, together
with offshore banking. Oil refining and storage ended in 2009. The
rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
in a substantial expansion of other activities. Over 1.5 million
tourists per year visit Aruba with 75% of those from the US.
Construction continues to boom with hotel capacity five times the
1985 level. Tourist arrivals rebounded strongly following a dip
after the 11 September 2001 attacks. The government has made cutting
the budget and trade deficits a high priority.
