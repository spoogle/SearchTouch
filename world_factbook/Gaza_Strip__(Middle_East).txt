Gaza Strip  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Gaza Strip




Background:


The September 1993 Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
Self-Government Arrangements provided for a transitional period of
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under a
series of agreements signed between May 1994 and September 1999,
Israel transferred to the Palestinian Authority (PA) security and
civilian responsibility for many Palestinian-populated areas of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Negotiations to determine the permanent
status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip stalled following the
outbreak of an intifada in September 2000. In April 2003, the
Quartet (US, EU, UN, and Russia) presented a roadmap to a final
settlement of the conflict by 2005 based on reciprocal steps by the
two parties leading to two states, Israel and a democratic
Palestine. Following Palestinian leader Yasir ARAFAT's death in late
2004, Mahmud ABBAS was elected PA president in January 2005. A month
later, Israel and the PA agreed to the Sharm el-Sheikh Commitments
in an effort to move the peace process forward. In September 2005,
Israel unilaterally withdrew all its settlers and soldiers and
dismantled its military facilities in the Gaza Strip and withdrew
settlers and redeployed soldiers from four small northern West Bank
settlements. Nonetheless, Israel still controls maritime, airspace,
and most access to the Gaza Strip; and it enforces a restricted zone
along the border inside Gaza. In January 2006, the Islamic
Resistance Movement, HAMAS, won control of the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC). HAMAS took control of the PA government
in March 2006, but President ABBAS had little success negotiating
with HAMAS to present a political platform acceptable to the
international community so as to lift economic sanctions on
Palestinians. Violent clashes between Fatah and HAMAS supporters in
the Gaza Strip in 2006 and early 2007 resulted in numerous
Palestinian deaths and injuries. In February 2007, ABBAS and HAMAS
Political Bureau Chief MISHAL signed the Mecca Agreement in Saudi
Arabia that resulted in the formation of a Palestinian National
Unity Government (NUG) headed by HAMAS member Ismail HANIYA.
However, fighting continued in the Gaza Strip, and in June 2007,
HAMAS militants succeeded in a violent takeover of all military and
governmental institutions in the Gaza Strip. ABBAS dismissed the NUG
and through a series of presidential decrees formed a PA government
in the West Bank led by independent Salam FAYYAD. HAMAS rejected the
NUG's dismissal, and despite multiple rounds of Egyptian-brokered
reconciliation negotiations, the two groups have failed to bridge
their differences. Late November 2007 through June 2008 witnessed a
substantial increase in Israeli-Palestinian violence. An
Egyptian-brokered truce in June 2008 between Israel and HAMAS
brought about a five-month pause in hostilities, but spiraling
end-of-year violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1,100 to
1,400 Palestinians and left tens of thousands of people homeless.
International donors pledged $4.5 billion in aid to rebuild the Gaza
Strip, but by the end of 2010 large-scale reconstruction had not
begun.

Economy ::Gaza Strip




Economy - overview:


High population density, limited land and sea access, continuing
isolation, and strict internal and external security controls have
degraded economic conditions in the Gaza Strip - the smaller of the
two areas in the Palestinian Territories. Israeli-imposed crossings
closures, which became more restrictive after HAMAS violently took
over the territory in June 2007, and fighting between HAMAS and
Israel during December 2008-January 2009, resulted in the near
collapse of most of the private sector, extremely high unemployment,
and high poverty rates. Shortages of goods are met through
large-scale humanitarian assistance - led by UNRWA - and the
HAMAS-regulated black market tunnel trade that flourishes under the
Gaza Strip's border with Egypt. However, chnages to the blockade in
2010 included moving from a white list - in which only approved
items were allowed into Gaza through the crossings - to a black
list, where all but non-approved items were allowed into Gaza
through the crossings. Israeli authorities have recently signaled
that exports from the territory might be possible in the future, but
currently regular exports from Gaza are not permitted.
