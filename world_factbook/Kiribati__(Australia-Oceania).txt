Kiribati  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Kiribati




Background:


The Gilbert Islands became a British protectorate in 1892 and a
colony in 1915; they were captured by the Japanese in the Pacific
War in 1941. The islands of Makin and Tarawa were the sites of major
US amphibious victories over entrenched Japanese garrisons in 1943.
The Gilbert Islands were granted self-rule by the UK in 1971 and
complete independence in 1979 under the new name of Kiribati. The US
relinquished all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix and Line
Island groups in a 1979 treaty of friendship with Kiribati.







Geography ::Kiribati




Location:


Oceania, group of 33 coral atolls in the Pacific Ocean, straddling
the Equator; the capital Tarawa is about half way between Hawaii and
Australia; note - on 1 January 1995, Kiribati proclaimed that all of
its territory was in the same time zone as its Gilbert Islands group
(UTC +12) even though the Phoenix Islands and the Line Islands under
its jurisdiction were on the other side of the International Date
Line

Economy ::Kiribati




Economy - overview:


A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has few
natural resources and is one of the least developed Pacific Islands.
Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of
independence from the UK in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the
bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in
recent years. Economic development is constrained by a shortage of
skilled workers, weak infrastructure, and remoteness from
international markets. Tourism provides more than one-fifth of GDP.
Private sector initiatives and a financial sector are in the early
stages of development. Foreign financial aid from the EU, UK, US,
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UN agencies, and Taiwan
accounts for 20-25% of GDP. Remittances from seamen on merchant
ships abroad account for more than $5 million each year. Kiribati
receives around $15 million annually for the government budget from
an Australian trust fund.
