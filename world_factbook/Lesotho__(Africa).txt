Lesotho  (Africa)

Introduction ::Lesotho




Background:


Basutoland was renamed the Kingdom of Lesotho upon independence from
the UK in 1966. The Basuto National Party ruled for the first two
decades. King MOSHOESHOE was exiled in 1990, but returned to Lesotho
in 1992 and was reinstated in 1995. Constitutional government was
restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998,
violent protests and a military mutiny following a contentious
election prompted a brief but bloody intervention by South African
and Botswana military forces under the aegis of the Southern African
Development Community. Subsequent constitutional reforms restored
relative political stability. Peaceful parliamentary elections were
held in 2002, but the National Assembly elections of February 2007
were hotly contested and aggrieved parties continue to dispute how
the electoral law was applied to award proportional seats in the
Assembly.

Economy ::Lesotho




Economy - overview:


Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho relies on remittances
from miners employed in South Africa, customs duties from the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), and export revenue for the
majority of government revenue. However, the government has recently
strengthened its tax system to reduce dependency on customs duties.
Completion of a major hydropower facility in January 1998 permitted
the sale of water to South Africa and generated royalties for
Lesotho. Lesotho produces about 90% of its own electrical power
needs. As the number of mineworkers has declined steadily over the
past several years, a small manufacturing base has developed based
on farm products that support the milling, canning, leather, and
jute industries, as well as an apparel-assembly sector. Despite
Lesotho's market-based economy being heavily tied to its neighbor
South Africa, the US is an important trade partner because of the
export sector's heavy dependence on apparel exports. Exports have
grown significantly because of the trade benefits contained in the
Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. The economy is still primarily
based on subsistence agriculture, especially livestock, although
drought has decreased agricultural activity. The extreme inequality
in the distribution of income remains a major drawback. Lesotho has
signed an Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the
IMF. In July 2007, Lesotho signed a Millennium Challenge Account
Compact with the US worth $362.5 million. Economic growth dropped in
2009, due mainly to the effects of the global economic crisis as
demand for the country's exports declined and SACU revenue fell
precipitously when South Africa - the primary contributor to the
SACU revenue pool - went into recession, but growth returned to 3.5%
in 2010.

Military - note:


Lesotho's declared policy is maintenance of its independent
sovereignty and preservation of internal security; in practice,
external security is guaranteed by South Africa; restructuring of
the Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) and Ministry of Defense and Public
Service over the past five years has focused on subordinating the
defense apparatus to civilian control and restoring the LDF's
cohesion; the restructuring has considerably improved capabilities
and professionalism, but the LDF is disproportionately large for a
small, poor country; the government has outlined a reduction to a
planned 1,500-man strength, but these plans have met with vociferous
resistance from the political opposition and from inside the LDF
