Algeria  (Africa)

Introduction ::Algeria




Background:


After more than a century of rule by France, Algerians fought
through much of the 1950s to achieve independence in 1962. Algeria's
primary political party, the National Liberation Front (FLN), was
established in 1954 as part of the struggle for independence and has
largely dominated politics since. The Government of Algeria in 1988
instituted a multi-party system in response to public unrest, but
the surprising first round success of the Islamic Salvation Front
(FIS) in the December 1991 balloting spurred the Algerian army to
intervene and postpone the second round of elections to prevent what
the secular elite feared would be an extremist-led government from
assuming power. The army began a crackdown on the FIS that spurred
FIS supporters to begin attacking government targets, and fighting
escalated into an insurgency, which saw intense violence between
1992-98 resulting in over 100,000 deaths - many attributed to
indiscriminate massacres of villagers by extremists. The government
gained the upper hand by the late-1990s, and FIS's armed wing, the
Islamic Salvation Army, disbanded in January 2000. Abdelaziz
BOUTEFLIKA, with the backing of the military, won the presidency in
1999 in an election widely viewed as fraudulent, was reelected to a
second term in 2004, and overwhelmingly won a third term in 2009
after the government amended the constitution in 2008 to remove
presidential term limits. Longstanding problems continue to face
BOUTEFLIKA, including large-scale unemployment, a shortage of
housing, unreliable electrical and water supplies, government
inefficiencies and corruption, and the continuing activities of
extremist militants. The Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat
(GSPC) in 2006 merged with al-Qai'da to form al-Qai'da in the Lands
of the Islamic Maghreb, which has launched an ongoing series of
kidnappings and bombings targeting the Algerian Government and
Western interests.

Economy ::Algeria




Economy - overview:


Algeria's economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the
country's socialist post-independence development model. Gradual
liberalization since the mid-1990s has opened up more of the
economy, but in recent years Algeria has imposed new restrictions on
foreign involvement in its economy and largely halted the
privatization of state-owned industries. Hydrocarbons have long been
the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget
revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has
the eighth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the
fourth-largest gas exporter. It ranks 16th in oil reserves. Thanks
to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $150
billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon
stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's external debt is
extremely low at about 1% of GDP. Algeria has struggled to develop
industires outside of hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and
an inert state bureaucracy.The government's efforts to diversify the
economy by attracting foregin and domestic investment outside the
energy sector have done little to reduce high poverty and youth
unemployment rates. In 2010, Algeria began a five-year, $286 billion
development program to update the country's infrastructure and
provide jobs. The costly program will boost Algeria's economy in
2011 but worsen the country's budget deficit. Long-term economic
challenges include diversification from hydrocarbons, relaxing state
control of the economy, and providing adequate jobs for youger
Algerians.

Telephone system:


general assessment: privatization of Algeria's telecommunications
sector began in 2000; three mobile cellular licenses have been
issued and, in 2005, a consortium led by Egypt's Orascom Telecom won
a 15-year license to build and operate a fixed-line network in
Algeria; the license will allow Orascom to develop high-speed data
and other specialized services and contribute to meeting the large
unfulfilled demand for basic residential telephony; Internet
broadband services began in 2003

domestic: a limited network of fixed lines with a teledensity of
less than 10 telephones per 100 persons is offset by the rapid
increase in mobile-cellular subscribership; in 2009, combined
fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity was roughly 100
telephones per 100 persons

Transnational Issues ::Algeria




Disputes - international:


Algeria, and many other states, rejects Moroccan administration of
Western Sahara; the Polisario Front, exiled in Algeria, represents
the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic; Algeria's border with Morocco
remains an irritant to bilateral relations, each nation accusing the
other of harboring militants and arms smuggling; Algeria remains
concerned about armed bandits operating throughout the Sahel who
sometimes destabilize southern Algerian towns; dormant disputes
include Libyan claims of about 32,000 sq km still reflected on its
maps of southeastern Algeria and the FLN's assertions of a claim to
Chirac Pastures in southeastern Morocco



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 90,000 (Western Saharan Sahrawi,
mostly living in Algerian-sponsored camps in the southwestern
Algerian town of Tindouf)

IDPs: undetermined (civil war during 1990s) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Algeria is a transit country for men and women
trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude; criminal
networks of sub-Saharan nationals in southern Algeria facilitate
transit by arranging transportation, forged documents, and promises
of employment

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Algeria is placed on the Tier 2
Watch List because it does not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking, however, it is making
significant efforts to do so; in January 2009, the government
approved new legislation that criminalizes trafficking in persons
for the purposes of labor and sexual exploitation representing an
important step toward complying with international standards;
despite these efforts, the government did not show overall progress
in punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims
and continued to lack adequate measures to protect victims and
prevent trafficking (2009)
