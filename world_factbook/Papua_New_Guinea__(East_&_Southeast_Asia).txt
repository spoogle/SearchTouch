Papua New Guinea  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Papua New Guinea




Background:


The eastern half of the island of New Guinea - second largest in the
world - was divided between Germany (north) and the UK (south) in
1885. The latter area was transferred to Australia in 1902, which
occupied the northern portion during World War I and continued to
administer the combined areas until independence in 1975. A
nine-year secessionist revolt on the island of Bougainville ended in
1997 after claiming some 20,000 lives.

volcanism: Papua New Guinea experiences severe volcanic activity;
Ulawun (elev. 2,334 m, 7,657 ft), one of Papua New Guinea's
potentially most dangerous volcanoes, has been deemed a "Decade
Volcano" by the International Association of Volcanology and
Chemistry of the Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its
explosive history and close proximity to human populations; Rabaul
(elev. 688 m, 2,257 ft) destroyed the city of Rabaul in 1937 and
1994; Lamington erupted in 1951 killing 3,000 people; Manam's 2004

People - note:


the indigenous population of Papua New Guinea is one of the most
heterogeneous in the world; PNG has several thousand separate
communities, most with only a few hundred people; divided by
language, customs, and tradition, some of these communities have
engaged in low-scale tribal conflict with their neighbors for
millennia; the advent of modern weapons and modern migrants into
urban areas has greatly magnified the impact of this lawlessness

Economy ::Papua New Guinea




Economy - overview:


Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but
exploitation has been hampered by rugged terrain and the high cost
of developing infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence
livelihood for 85% of the population. Mineral deposits, including
copper, gold, and oil, account for nearly two-thirds of export
earnings. Natural gas reserves amount to an estimated 227 billion
cubic meters. A consortium led by a major American oil company is
constructing a liquefied natural gas (LNG) production facility that
could begin exporting in 2013 or 2014. As the largest investment
project in the country's history, it has the potential to double GDP
in the near-term and triple Papua New Guinea's export revenue. The
government faces the challenge of ensuring transparency and
accountability for revenues flowing from this and other large LNG
projects. The government of Prime Minister SOMARE has expended much
of its energy remaining in power. He was the first prime minister
ever to serve a full five-year term. The government has brought
stability to the national budget, largely through expenditure
control; however, it relaxed spending constraints in 2006 and 2007
as elections approached. Numerous challenges still face the
government, including providing physical security for foreign
investors, regaining investor confidence, restoring integrity to
state institutions, promoting economic efficiency by privatizing
moribund state institutions, and balancing relations with Australia,
its former colonial ruler. Other socio-cultural challenges could
upend the economy including an HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the highest
infection rate in all of East Asia and the Pacific, and chronic law
and order and land tenure issues. The global financial crisis had
little impact because of continued high demand for Papua New
Guinea's commodities exports.
