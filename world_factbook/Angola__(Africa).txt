Angola  (Africa)

Introduction ::Angola




Background:


Angola is rebuilding its country after the end of a 27-year civil
war in 2002. Fighting between the Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA), led by Jose Eduardo DOS SANTOS, and the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by
Jonas SAVIMBI, followed independence from Portugal in 1975. Peace
seemed imminent in 1992 when Angola held national elections, but
fighting picked up again by 1996. Up to 1.5 million lives may have
been lost - and 4 million people displaced - in the quarter century
of fighting. SAVIMBI's death in 2002 ended UNITA's insurgency and
strengthened the MPLA's hold on power. President DOS SANTOS held
legislative elections in September 2008 and, despite promising to
hold presidential elections in 2009, has since made a presidential
poll contingent on the drafting of a new constitution.

Economy ::Angola




Economy - overview:


Angola's high growth rate in recent years was driven by high
international prices for its oil. Angola became a member of OPEC in
late 2006 and in late 2007 was assigned a production quota of 1.9
million barrels a day (bbl/day), somewhat less than the 2-2.5
million bbl/day Angola's government had wanted. Oil production and
its supporting activities contribute about 85% of GDP. Diamond
exports contribute an additional 5%. Subsistence agriculture
provides the main livelihood for most of the people, but half of the
country's food is still imported. Increased oil production supported
growth averaging more than 15% per year from 2004 to 2008. A postwar
reconstruction boom and resettlement of displaced persons has led to
high rates of growth in construction and agriculture as well. Much
of the country's infrastructure is still damaged or undeveloped from
the 27-year-long civil war. Land mines left from the war still mar
the countryside, even though peace was established after the death
of rebel leader Jonas SAVIMBI in February 2002. Since 2005, the
government has used billions of dollars in credit lines from China,
Brazil, Portugal, Germany, Spain, and the EU to rebuild Angola's
public infrastructure. The global recession temporarily stalled
economic growth. Lower prices for oil and diamonds during the global
recession led to a contraction in GDP in 2009, and many construction
projects stopped because Luanda accrued $9 billion in arrears to
foreign construction companies when government revenue fell in 2008
and 2009. Angola abandoned its currency peg in 2009, and in November
2009 signed onto an IMF Stand-By Arrangement loan of $1.4 billion to
rebuild international reserves. Although consumer inflation declined
from 325% in 2000 to under 14% in 2010, Luanda has been unable to
reduce inflation below 10%. The Angolan kwanza depreciated again in
mid 2010, which, along with higher oil prices, should boost economic
growth in all sectors. Corruption, especially in the extractive
sectors, also is a major challenge.

providers had expanded to 5; Angola Telecom established
mobile-cellular service in Luanda in 1993 and the network has been
extended to larger towns; a privately-owned, mobile-cellular service
provider began operations in 2001

domestic: only about two fixed-lines per 100 persons; combined
fixed-line and mobile-cellular teledensity about 65 telephones per
100 persons in 2009

Broadcast media:


state controls all broadcast media with nationwide reach;
state-owned Televisao Popular de Angola (TPA) provides terrestrial
TV service on 2 channels; a third TPA channel is available via cable
and satellite; TV subscription services are available; state-owned
Radio Nacional de Angola (RNA) broadcasts on 5 stations; about a
