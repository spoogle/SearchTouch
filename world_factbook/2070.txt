Field Listing :: Disputes - international

  This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from
  traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one
  sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international
  terrestrial and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the US
  Department of State. References to other situations involving
  borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource
  disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues; however,
  inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or
  recognition by the US Government.

  Disputes - international

Afghanistan
  Pakistan has built fences in some portions of its border
  with Afghanistan which remains open in some areas to foreign
  terrorists and other illegal activities

Albania
  the Albanian Government calls for the protection of the
  rights of ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries, and the
  peaceful resolution of interethnic disputes; some ethnic Albanian
  groups in neighboring countries advocate for a "greater Albania,"
  but the idea has little appeal among Albanian nationals; the mass
  emigration of unemployed Albanians remains a problem for developed
  countries, chiefly Greece and Italy

Algeria
  Algeria, and many other states, rejects Moroccan
  administration of Western Sahara; the Polisario Front, exiled in
  Algeria, represents the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic; Algeria's
  border with Morocco remains an irritant to bilateral relations, each
  nation accusing the other of harboring militants and arms smuggling;
  Algeria remains concerned about armed bandits operating throughout
  the Sahel who sometimes destabilize southern Algerian towns; dormant
  disputes include Libyan claims of about 32,000 sq km still reflected
  on its maps of southeastern Algeria and the FLN's assertions of a
  claim to Chirac Pastures in southeastern Morocco

American Samoa
  Tokelau periodically asserts claims to American
  Samoa's Swains Island (Olohega), such as in its 2006 draft
  independence constitution

Andorra
  none

Angola
  Cabindan separatists continue to return to the Angolan
  exclave from exile in neighboring states and Europe since the 2006
  ceasefire and peace agreement

Anguilla
  none

Antarctica
  the Antarctic Treaty freezes, and most states do not
  recognize, the land and maritime territorial claims made by
  Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the
  United Kingdom (some overlapping) for three-fourths of the
  continent; the US and Russia reserve the right to make claims; no
  formal claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees west
  and 150 degrees west; the International Whaling Commission created a
  sanctuary around the entire continent to deter catches by countries
  claiming to conduct scientific whaling; Australia has established a
  similar preserve in the waters around its territorial claim

Antigua and Barbuda
  none

Arctic Ocean
  the littoral states are engaged in various stages of
  demonstrating the limits of their continental shelves beyond 200
  nautical miles from their declared baselines in accordance with
  Article 76, paragraph 8, of the United Nations Convention on the Law
  of the Sea; record summer melting of sea ice in the Arctic has
  restimulated interest in maritime shipping lanes and sea floor
  exploration

Argentina
  Argentina continues to assert its claims to the
  UK-administered Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Georgia,
  and the South Sandwich Islands in its constitution, forcibly
  occupying the Falklands in 1982, but in 1995 agreed no longer to
  seek settlement by force; territorial claim in Antarctica partially
  overlaps UK and Chilean claims; unruly region at convergence of
  Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money laundering,
  smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics trafficking, and fundraising
  for extremist organizations; uncontested dispute between Brazil and
  Uruguay over Braziliera/Brasiliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim
  River leaves the tripoint with Argentina in question; in 2006,
  Argentina went to the ICJ to protest, on environmental grounds, the
  construction of two pulp mills in Uruguay on the Uruguay River,
  which forms the boundary; both parties presented their pleadings in
  2007 with Argentina's reply in January and Uruguay's rejoinder in
  July 2008; the joint boundary commission, established by Chile and
  Argentina in 2001 has yet to map and demarcate the delimited
  boundary in the inhospitable Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de
  Hielo Sur)

Armenia
  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in
  Nagorno-Karabakh and since the early 1990s, has militarily occupied
  16% of Azerbaijan - Organization for Security and Cooperation in
  Europe (OSCE) continues to mediate dispute; over 800,000 mostly
  ethnic Azerbaijanis were driven from the occupied lands and Armenia;
  about 230,000 ethnic Armenians were driven from their homes in
  Azerbaijan into Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh; Azerbaijan seeks
  transit route through Armenia to connect to Naxcivan exclave; border
  with Turkey remains closed over Nagorno-Karabakh dispute; ethnic
  Armenian groups in Javakheti region of Georgia seek greater
  autonomy; Armenians continue to emigrate, primarily to Russia,
  seeking employment

Aruba
  none

Ashmore and Cartier Islands
  as the closest Australian territory to
  Indonesia, these islands became the target of human traffickers for
  the landing of illegal immigrants; in 2001, the Australian
  government removed these islands from the Australian Migration Zone
  making illegal arrivals ineligible for temporary visas and entry
  into Australia

Atlantic Ocean
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

Australia
  In 2007 Australia and Timor-Leste signed a 50-year
  development zone and revenue sharing agreement in lieu of a maritime
  boundary; dispute with Timor-Leste hampers creation of a revised
  maritime boundary with Indonesia in the Timor Sea; regional states
  continue to express concern over Australia's 2004 declaration of a
  1,000-nautical mile-wide maritime identification zone; Australia
  asserts land and maritime claims to Antarctica; in 2004 Australia
  submitted its claims to Commission on the Limits of the Continental
  Shelf (CLCS) to extend its continental margins covering over 3.37
  million square kilometers, expanding its seabed roughly 30 percent
  more than its claimed exclusive economic zone; since 2003, Australia
  has led the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands
  (RAMSI) to maintain civil and political order and reinforce regional
  security

Austria
  while threats of international legal action never
  materialized in 2007, 915,220 Austrians, with the support of the
  newly elected Freedom Party, signed a petition in January 2008,
  demanding that Austria block the Czech Republic's accession to the
  EU unless Prague closed its nuclear power plant in Temelin,
  bordering Austria

Azerbaijan
  Armenia supports ethnic Armenian secessionists in
  Nagorno-Karabakh and since the early 1990s has militarily occupied
  16% of Azerbaijan; over 800,000 mostly ethnic Azerbaijanis were
  driven from the occupied lands and Armenia; about 230,000 ethnic
  Armenians were driven from their homes in Azerbaijan into Armenia
  and Nagorno-Karabakh; Azerbaijan seeks transit route through Armenia
  to connect to Naxcivan exclave; Organization for Security and
  Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) continues to mediate dispute;
  Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia have ratified Caspian seabed
  delimitation treaties based on equidistance, while Iran continues to
  insist on an even one-fifth allocation and challenges Azerbaijan's
  hydrocarbon exploration in disputed waters; bilateral talks continue
  with Turkmenistan on dividing the seabed and contested oilfields in
  the middle of the Caspian; Azerbaijan and Georgia continue to
  discuss the alignment of their boundary at certain crossing areas

  waters

Bahrain
  none

Bangladesh
  discussions with India remain stalled to delimit a small
  section of river boundary, exchange territory for 51 small
  Bangladeshi exclaves in India and 111 small Indian exclaves in
  Bangladesh, allocate divided villages, and stop illegal cross-border
  trade, migration, violence, and transit of terrorists through the
  porous border; Bangladesh protests India's fencing and walling off
  high-traffic sections of the porous boundary; a joint
  Bangladesh-India boundary commission resurveyed and reconstructed 92
  missing pillars in 2007; after 21 years, Bangladesh in January 2008
  resumed talks with Burma on delimiting a maritime boundary

Barbados
  Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago abide by the April 2006
  Permanent Court of Arbitration decision delimiting a maritime
  boundary and limiting catches of flying fish in Trinidad and
  Tobago's exclusive economic zone; joins other Caribbean states to
  counter Venezuela's claim that Aves Island sustains human
  habitation, a criterion under the UN Convention on the Law of the
  Sea (UNCLOS), which permits Venezuela to extend its EEZ/continental
  shelf over a large portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea

Belarus
  Boundary demarcated with Latvia and Lithuania in 2006; 1997
  boundary delimitation treaty with Ukraine remains unratified over
  unresolved financial claims, preventing demarcation and diminishing
  border security

Belgium
  none

Belize
  OAS-initiated Agreement on the Framework for Negotiations and
  Confidence Building Measures saw cooperation in repatriation of
  Guatemalan squatters and other areas, but Guatemalan land and
  maritime claims in Belize and the Caribbean Sea remain unresolved;
  the Line of Adjacency created under the 2002 Differendum serves in
  lieu of the contiguous international boundary to control squatting
  in the sparsely inhabited rain forests of Belize's border region;
  Honduras claims Belizean-administered Sapodilla Cays in its
  constitution but agreed to a joint ecological park under the
  Differendum

Benin
  in September 2007, Economic Community of West African States
  (ECOWAS) intervened to attempt to resolve the dispute over two
  villages along the Benin-Burkina Faso border that remain from 2005
  ICJ decision; much of Benin-Niger boundary, including tripoint with
  Nigeria, remains undemarcated; in 2005, Nigeria ceded thirteen
  villages to Benin, but border relations remain strained by rival
  cross-border gang clashes; talks continue between Benin and Togo on
  funding the Adjrala hydroelectric dam on the Mona River

Bermuda
  none

Bhutan
  Bhutan cooperates with India to expel Indian Nagaland
  separatists; lacking any treaty describing the boundary, Bhutan and
  China continue negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment
  to resolve territorial disputes arising from substantial
  cartographic discrepancies, the largest of which lie in Bhutan's
  northwest and along the Chumbi salient

Bolivia
  Chile and Peru rebuff Bolivia's reactivated claim to restore
  the Atacama corridor, ceded to Chile in 1884, but Chile offers
  instead unrestricted but not sovereign maritime access through Chile
  for Bolivian natural gas and other commodities; an accord placed the
  long-disputed Isla Suarez/Ilha de Guajara-Mirim, a fluvial island on
  the Rio Mamore, under Bolivian administration in 1958, but
  sovereignty remains in dispute

Bosnia and Herzegovina
  sections along the Drina River remain in
  dispute between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia; discussions
  continue with Croatia on several small disputed sections of the
  boundary related to maritime access that hinder final ratification
  of the 1999 border agreement

Botswana
  Botswana still struggles to seal its border from thousands
  of Zimbabweans who flee economic collapse and political persecution;
  Namibia has long supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections
  to, plans between Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the
  Zambezi River at Kazungula crossing, thereby de facto recognizing
  the short, but not clearly delimited, Botswana-Zambia boundary

Bouvet Island
  none

Brazil
  unruly region at convergence of Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay
  borders is locus of money laundering, smuggling, arms and illegal
  narcotics trafficking, and fundraising for extremist organizations;
  two uncontested boundary disputes with Uruguay over Isla Brasilera
  at the tripoint with Argentina at the confluence of the
  Quarai/Cuareim and Uruguay rivers, and in the 235 square kilometer
  Invernada River region over which tributary represents the
  legitimate source of the Quarai/Cuareim River; the Itaipu Dam
  reservoir covers over a once contested section of Brazil-Paraguay
  boundary west of Guaira Falls on the Rio Parana; an accord placed
  the long-disputed Isla Suarez/Ilha de Guajara-Mirim, a fluvial
  island on the Rio Mamore, under Bolivian administration in 1958, but
  sovereignty remains in dispute

British Indian Ocean Territory
  Mauritius claims the Chagos
  Archipelago including Diego Garcia; in 2001, the former inhabitants
  of the Chagos Archipelago, evicted in 1967 and 1973 and now residing
  chiefly in Mauritius, were granted UK citizenship and the right to
  repatriation; in May 2007, the UK Court of Appeals upheld the May
  2006 High Court of London judgment reversing the UK government's
  2004 Orders of Council that banned habitation on the islands; a
  small group of Chagossians visited Diego Garcia in April 2006;
  repatriation is complicated by the exclusive US military lease of
  Diego Garcia that restricts access to the largest viable island in
  the chain

British Virgin Islands
  none

Brunei
  Brunei and Malaysia agreed in September 2008 to resolve their
  offshore and deepwater seabed dispute, resume hydrocarbon
  exploration, and renounce any territorial claims along their land
  boundary; despite no public territorial claim to Louisa Reef, Brunei
  implicitly lays claim by including it within the natural
  prolongation of its continental shelf and basis for a seabed median
  with Vietnam; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the
  South China Sea" has eased tensions in the Spratly Islands but falls
  short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by several of
  the disputants

Bulgaria
  none

Burkina Faso
  in September 2007, Economic Community of West African
  States (ECOWAS) intervened to attempt to resolve the dispute over
  two villages along the Benin-Burkina Faso border that remain from a
  2005 ICJ decision; in recent years citizens and rogue security
  forces rob and harass local populations on both sides of the poorly
  defined Burkina Faso-Niger border; despite the presence of more than
  9,000 UN forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict
  continues to spread into neighboring states that can no longer send
  their migrant workers to work in Ivorian cocoa plantations

Burma
  over half of Burma's population consists of diverse ethnic
  groups who have substantial numbers of kin in neighboring countries;
  Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic refugees, asylum
  seekers, and rebels, as well as illegal cross-border activities from
  Burma; Thailand is studying the feasibility of jointly constructing
  the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween River near the border with Burma;
  citing environmental, cultural, and social concerns, China is
  reconsidering construction of 13 dams on the Salween River but
  energy-starved Burma with backing from Thailand remains intent on
  building five hydro-electric dams downstream, despite identical
  regional and international protests; India seeks cooperation from
  Burma to keep Indian Nagaland separatists, such as the United
  Liberation Front of Assam, from hiding in remote Burmese Uplands;

  Vihear temple ruins, awarded to Cambodia by ICJ decision in 1962, as
  part of a planned UN World Heritage site

Cameroon

  have driven hundreds of thousands of Darfur residents into Chad;
  Chad remains an important mediator in the Sudanese civil conflict,
  reducing tensions with Sudan arising from cross-border banditry;
  Chadian Aozou rebels reside in southern Libya; only Nigeria and
  Cameroon have heeded the Lake Chad Commission's admonition to ratify
  the delimitation treaty, which also includes the Chad-Niger and
  Niger-Nigeria boundaries

Chile
  Chile and Peru rebuff Bolivia's reinvigorated claim to restore
  the Atacama corridor, ceded to Chile in 1884, but Chile has offered
  instead unrestricted but not sovereign maritime access through Chile
  to Bolivian gas and other commodities; Chile rejects Peru's
  unilateral legislation to change its latitudinal maritime boundary
  with Chile to an equidistance line with a southwestern axis favoring
  Peru, in October 2007, Peru took its maritime complaint with Chile
  to the ICJ; territorial claim in Antarctica (Chilean Antarctic
  Territory) partially overlaps Argentine and British claims; the
  joint boundary commission, established by Chile and Argentina in
  2001, has yet to map and demarcate the delimited boundary in the

China
  continuing talks and confidence-building measures work toward
  reducing tensions over Kashmir that nonetheless remains militarized
  with portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai

  states of the South China Seas, where China has interrupted
  Vietnamese hydrocarbon exploration; China asserts sovereignty over
  Scarborough Reef along with the Philippines and Taiwan, and over the
  Spratly Islands together with Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan,
  Vietnam, and Brunei; the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties
  in the South China Sea" eased tensions in the Spratly's but is not
  the legally binding "code of conduct" sought by some parties;
  Vietnam and China continue to expand construction of facilities in
  the Spratly's and in March 2005, the national oil companies of
  China, the Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord on marine
  seismic activities in the Spratly Islands; China occupies some of
  the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; China and

  Rican vessels on the Rio San Juan over which Nicaragua retains
  sovereignty

Cote d'Ivoire
  despite the presence of over 9,000 UN forces (UNOCI)
  in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict still leaves displaced
  hundreds of thousands of Ivorians in and out of the country as well
  as driven out migrants from neighboring states who worked in Ivorian
  cocoa plantations; the March 2007 peace deal between Ivorian rebels
  and the government brought significant numbers of rebels out of
  hiding in neighboring states

Croatia
  dispute remains with Bosnia and Herzegovina over several
  small sections of the boundary related to maritime access that
  hinders ratification of the 1999 border agreement; the
  Croatia-Slovenia land and maritime boundary agreement, which would
  have ceded most of Pirin Bay and maritime access to Slovenia and
  several villages to Croatia, remains unratified and in dispute;

  2008, Eritrean troops move across the border on Ras Doumera
  peninsula and occupy Doumera Island with undefined sovereignty in
  the Red Sea

Dominica
  Dominica is the only Caribbean state to challenge
  Venezuela's sovereignty claim over Aves Island and joins the other
  island nations in challenging whether the feature sustains human
  habitation, a criterion under the UN Convention on the Law of the
  Sea (UNCLOS), which permits Venezuela to extend its Exclusive
  Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf claims over a large
  portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea

Dominican Republic

  economic development of Halaib region north of the 22nd parallel
  boundary; Egypt no longer shows its administration of the Bir Tawil
  trapezoid in Sudan on its maps; Gazan breaches in the security wall
  with Egypt in January 2008 highlight difficulties in monitoring the
  Sinai border; Saudi Arabia claims Egyptian-administered islands of
  Tiran and Sanafir

El Salvador
  International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on the
  delimitation of "bolsones" (disputed areas) along the El
  Salvador-Honduras boundary, in 1992, with final agreement by the
  parties in 2006 after an Organization of American States (OAS)
  survey and a further ICJ ruling in 2003; the 1992 ICJ ruling advised
  a tripartite resolution to a maritime boundary in the Gulf of
  Fonseca advocating Honduran access to the Pacific; El Salvador
  continues to claim tiny Conejo Island, not identified in the ICJ
  decision, off Honduras in the Gulf of Fonseca

Equatorial Guinea
  in 2002, ICJ ruled on an equidistance settlement
  of Cameroon-Equatorial Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf
  of Guinea, but a dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over
  an island at the mouth of the Ntem River and imprecisely defined
  maritime coordinates in the ICJ decision delay final delimitation;
  UN urges Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to resolve the sovereignty
  dispute over Gabon-occupied Mbane and lesser islands and to create a
  maritime boundary in the hydrocarbon-rich Corisco Bay

Eritrea
  Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by 2002
  Ethiopia-Eritrea Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision
  but, neither party responded to the revised line detailed in the
  November 2006 EEBC Demarcation Statement; Sudan accuses Eritrea of
  supporting eastern Sudanese rebel groups; in 2008 Eritrean troops
  move across the border on Ras Doumera peninsula and occupy Doumera
  Island with undefined sovereignty in the Red Sea

Estonia
  Russia recalled its signature to the 1996 technical border
  agreement with Estonia in 2005, rather than concede to Estonia's
  appending prepared a unilateral declaration referencing Soviet
  occupation and territorial losses; Russia demands better
  accommodation of Russian-speaking population in Estonia; Estonian
  citizen groups continue to press for realignment of the boundary
  based on the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now
  divided ethnic Setu people and parts of the Narva region within
  Estonia; as a member state that forms part of the EU's external
  border, Estonia must implement the strict Schengen border rules with
  Russia

Ethiopia
  Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by the 2002
  Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision,
  but neither party responded to the revised line detailed in the
  November 2006 EEBC Demarcation Statement; the undemarcated former
  British administrative line has little meaning as a political
  separation to rival clans within Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern
  Somalia's Oromo region; Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia
  and routed Islamist Courts from Mogadishu in January 2007;
  "Somaliland" secessionists provide port facilities in Berbera and
  trade ties to landlocked Ethiopia; civil unrest in eastern Sudan has
  hampered efforts to demarcate the porous boundary with Ethiopia

European Union
  as a political union, the EU has no border disputes
  with neighboring countries, but Estonia has no land boundary
  agreements with Russia, Slovenia disputes its land and maritime
  boundaries with Croatia, and Spain has territorial and maritime
  disputes with Morocco and with the UK over Gibraltar; the EU has set
  up a Schengen area - consisting of 22 EU member states that have
  signed the convention implementing the Schengen agreements or
  "acquis" (1985 and 1990) on the free movement of persons and the
  harmonization of border controls in Europe; these agreements became
  incorporated into EU law with the implementation of the 1997 Treaty
  of Amsterdam on 1 May 1999; in addition, non-EU states Iceland and
  Norway (as part of the Nordic Union) have been included in the
  Schengen area since 1996 (full members in 2001), and Switzerland
  since 2008 bringing the total current membership to 25; the UK
  (since 2000) and Ireland (since 2002) take part in only some aspects
  of the Schengen area, especially with respect to police and criminal
  matters; nine of the 12 new member states that joined the EU since
  2004 joined Schengen on 21 December 2007; of the three remaining EU
  states, Cyprus is expected to join by 2009, while Romania and
  Bulgaria continue to enhance their border security systems

Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)
  Argentina, which claims the
  islands in its constitution and briefly occupied them by force in
  1982, agreed in 1995 to no longer seek settlement by force; UK
  continues to reject Argentine requests for sovereignty talks

Faroe Islands
  because anticipated offshore hydrocarbon resources
  have not been realized, earlier Faroese proposals for full

  boundary to control squatting in the sparsely inhabited rain forests
  of Belize's border region; Mexico must deal with thousands of
  impoverished Guatemalans and other Central Americans who cross the
  porous border looking for work in Mexico and the United States

  occupation of these lands, including the hamlet of Yenga, occupied
  since 1998

Guinea-Bissau
  in 2006, political instability within Senegal's
  Casamance region resulted in thousands of Senegalese refugees,
  cross-border raids, and arms smuggling into Guinea-Bissau

Guyana
  all of the area west of the Essequibo River is claimed by
  Venezuela preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana
  has expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims
  before UNCLOS that Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with
  Venezuela extends into their waters; Suriname claims a triangle of
  land between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a historic dispute
  over the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks arbitration

  Salvador-Honduras border in 1992 with final settlement by the
  parties in 2006 after an Organization of American States (OAS)
  survey and a further ICJ ruling in 2003; the 1992 ICJ ruling advised
  a tripartite resolution to a maritime boundary in the Gulf of
  Fonseca with consideration of Honduran access to the Pacific; El
  Salvador continues to claim tiny Conejo Island, not mentioned in the
  ICJ ruling, off Honduras in the Gulf of Fonseca; Honduras claims the
  Belizean-administered Sapodilla Cays off the coast of Belize in its

Iceland
  Iceland, the UK, and Ireland dispute Denmark's claim that
  the Faroe Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm

India
  since China and India launched a security and foreign policy
  dialogue in 2005, consolidated discussions related to the dispute
  over most of their rugged, militarized boundary, regional nuclear
  proliferation, Indian claims that China transferred missiles to
  Pakistan, and other matters continue; various talks and
  confidence-building measures have cautiously begun to defuse
  tensions over Kashmir, particularly since the October 2005
  earthquake in the region; Kashmir nevertheless remains the site of
  the world's largest and most militarized territorial dispute with
  portions under the de facto administration of China (Aksai Chin),
  India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir and Northern
  Areas); India and Pakistan have maintained the 2004 cease fire in
  Kashmir and initiated discussions on defusing the armed stand-off in
  the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan protests India's fencing the

  cross-border activities from Nepal

Indian Ocean
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

Indonesia
  Indonesia has a stated foreign policy objective of
  establishing stable fixed land and maritime boundaries with all of
  its neighbors; some sections of border along Timor-Leste's Oecussi
  exclave and maritime boundaries with Timor-Leste remain unresolved;
  many refugees from Timor-Leste who left in 2003 still reside in
  Indonesia and refuse repatriation; a 1997 treaty between Indonesia
  and Australia settled some parts of their maritime boundary but
  outstanding issues remain; ICJ's award of Sipadan and Ligitan
  islands to Malaysia in 2002 left the sovereignty of Unarang rock and

  cross-border security; approximately two million Iraqis have fled
  the conflict in Iraq, with the majority taking refuge in Syria and
  Jordan, and lesser numbers to Egypt, Lebanon, Iran, and Turkey;

  withdrew its settlers and military from the Gaza Strip and from four
  settlements in the West Bank in August 2005; Golan Heights is
  Israeli-occupied (Lebanon claims the Shab'a Farms area of Golan
  Heights); since 1948, about 350 peacekeepers from the UN Truce

  Russia and claimed by Japan, remains the primary sticking point to
  signing a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities;
  Japan and South Korea claim Liancourt Rocks (Take-shima/Tok-do)
  occupied by South Korea since 1954; China and Taiwan dispute both
  Japan's claims to the uninhabited islands of the Senkaku-shoto

  made on dividing the water column among any of the littoral states

Kenya
  Kenya served as an important mediator in brokering Sudan's
  north-south separation in February 2005; Kenya provides shelter to
  almost a quarter of a million refugees, including Ugandans who flee
  across the border periodically to seek protection from Lord's
  Resistance Army (LRA) rebels; Kenya works hard to prevent the clan
  and militia fighting in Somalia from spreading across the border,
  which has long been open to nomadic pastoralists; the boundary that
  separates Kenya's and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi
  Triangle," which Kenya has administered since colonial times

  Mekong River; concern among Mekong Commission members that China's
  construction of dams on the Mekong River will affect water levels

Latvia
  Russia demands better Latvian treatment of ethnic Russians in
  Latvia; as of January 2007, ground demarcation of the boundary with
  Belarus was complete and mapped with final ratification
  documentation in preparation; the Latvian parliament has not
  ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with Lithuania, primarily
  due to concerns over oil exploration rights; as a member state that
  forms part of the EU's external border, Latvia has implemented the
  strict Schengen border rules with Russia

Lebanon
  lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the
  boundary, portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with
  several sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a
  Farms area in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights; the roughly
  2,000-strong UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been in place
  since 1978

Lesotho
  none

Liberia
  although civil unrest continues to abate with the assistance
  of 18,000 UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) peacekeepers, as of January
  2007, Liberian refugees still remain in Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire,
  Sierra Leone, and Ghana; Liberia, in turn, shelters refugees fleeing
  turmoil in Cote d'Ivoire; despite the presence of over 9,000 UN
  forces (UNOCI) in Cote d'Ivoire since 2004, ethnic conflict
  continues to spread into neighboring states who can no longer send
  their migrant workers to Ivorian cocoa plantations; UN sanctions ban
  Liberia from exporting diamonds and timber

  Lithuania and Russia committed to demarcating their
  boundary in 2006 in accordance with the land and maritime treaty
  ratified by Russia in May 2003 and by Lithuania in 1999; Lithuania
  operates a simplified transit regime for Russian nationals traveling
  from the Kaliningrad coastal exclave into Russia, while still
  conforming, as a EU member state having an external border with a
  non-EU member, to strict Schengen border rules; the Latvian
  parliament has not ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with
  Lithuania, primarily due to concerns over potential hydrocarbons; as
  of January 2007, ground demarcation of the boundary with Belarus was
  complete and mapped with final ratification documents in preparation

  Malawi) and the meandering Songwe River remain dormant

Malaysia
  Malaysia is involved in a complex dispute with Brunei,
  China, Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam over claims to part or all
  of the Spratly Islands; while the 2002 "Declaration on the Conduct
  of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions over the
  Spratly Islands, it is not the legally binding "code of conduct"
  sought by some parties; Malaysia was not party to the March 2005
  joint accord among the national oil companies of China, the
  Philippines, and Vietnam on conducting marine seismic activities in
  the Spratly Islands; disputes continue over deliveries of fresh
  water to Singapore, Singapore's land reclamation, bridge
  construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore
  Straits; in 2008, ICJ awards sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu
  Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia,
  but does not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of
  South Ledge; ICJ awarded Ligitan and Sipadan islands, also claimed
  by Indonesia and Philippines, to Malaysia but left maritime boundary
  and sovereignty of Unarang rock in the hydrocarbon-rich Celebes Sea
  in dispute; separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Muslim
  southern provinces prompts measures to close and monitor border with
  Malaysia to stem terrorist activities; Philippines retains a dormant
  claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo; Brunei and
  Malaysia agreed in September 2008 to resolve their offshore and
  deepwater seabed dispute, resume hydrocarbon exploration, and

  Morocco protests Spain's control over the coastal enclaves of Ceuta,
  Melilla, and Penon de Velez de la Gomera, the islands of Penon de
  Alhucemas and Islas Chafarinas, and surrounding waters; both
  countries claim Isla Perejil (Leila Island); discussions have not
  progressed on a comprehensive maritime delimitation, setting limits
  on resource exploration and refugee interdiction, since Morocco's
  2002 rejection of Spain's unilateral designation of a median line
  from the Canary Islands; Morocco serves as one of the primary
  launching areas of illegal migration into Spain from North Africa

  over the Okavango Delta ecology in Botswana and human displacement
  scuttled Namibian plans to construct a hydroelectric dam on Popa
  Falls along the Angola-Namibia border; managed dispute with South
  Africa over the location of the boundary in the Orange River;
  Namibia has supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections to,

Nigeria
  Joint Border Commission with Cameroon reviewed 2002 ICJ
  ruling on the entire boundary and bilaterally resolved differences,
  including June 2006 Greentree Agreement that immediately cedes
  sovereignty of the Bakassi Peninsula to Cameroon with a phase-out of
  Nigerian control within two years while resolving patriation issues;
  the ICJ ruled on an equidistance settlement of Cameroon-Equatorial
  Guinea-Nigeria maritime boundary in the Gulf of Guinea, but
  imprecisely defined coordinates in the ICJ decision and a
  sovereignty dispute between Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon over an
  island at the mouth of the Ntem River all contribute to the delay in
  implementation; only Nigeria and Cameroon have heeded the Lake Chad
  Commission's admonition to ratify the delimitation treaty which also
  includes the Chad-Niger and Niger-Nigeria boundaries

Pacific Ocean
  some maritime disputes (see littoral states)

Pakistan
  various talks and confidence-building measures cautiously
  have begun to defuse tensions over Kashmir, particularly since the
  October 2005 earthquake in the region; Kashmir nevertheless remains
  the site of the world's largest and most militarized territorial
  dispute with portions under the de facto administration of China
  (Aksai Chin), India (Jammu and Kashmir), and Pakistan (Azad Kashmir
  and Northern Areas); UN Military Observer Group in India and
  Pakistan (UNMOGIP) has maintained a small group of peacekeepers
  since 1949; India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding historic
  Kashmir lands to China in 1964; India and Pakistan have maintained
  their 2004 cease fire in Kashmir and initiated discussions on
  defusing the armed stand-off in the Siachen glacier region; Pakistan
  protests India's fencing the highly militarized Line of Control and
  construction of the Baglihar Dam on the Chenab River in Jammu and
  Kashmir, which is part of the larger dispute on water sharing of the
  Indus River and its tributaries; to defuse tensions and prepare for
  discussions on a maritime boundary, India and Pakistan seek
  technical resolution of the disputed boundary in Sir Creek estuary
  at the mouth of the Rann of Kutch in the Arabian Sea; Pakistani maps
  continue to show the Junagadh claim in India's Gujarat State; by
  2005, Pakistan, with UN assistance, repatriated 2.3 million Afghan
  refugees leaving slightly more than a million, many of whom remain
  at their own choosing; Pakistan has proposed and Afghanistan
  protests construction of a fence and laying of mines along portions
  of their porous border; Pakistan has sent troops into remote tribal
  areas to monitor and control the border with Afghanistan and to stem
  terrorist or other illegal activities

Panama
  organized illegal narcotics operations in Colombia operate
  within the remote border region with Panama

Papua New Guinea

  illegal cross-border activities from primarily Indonesia, including
  goods smuggling, illegal narcotics trafficking, and squatters and
  secessionists

Paracel Islands
  occupied by China, also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam

Paraguay
  unruly region at convergence of Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay
  borders is locus of money laundering, smuggling, arms and illegal
  narcotics trafficking, and fundraising for extremist organizations

Peru
  Chile and Ecuador rejected Peru's November 2005 unilateral
  legislation to shift the axis of their joint treaty-defined maritime
  boundaries along the parallels of latitude to equidistance lines
  which favor Peru; organized illegal narcotics operations in Colombia
  have penetrated Peru's shared border; Peru rejects Bolivia's claim
  to restore maritime access through a sovereign corridor through
  Chile along the Peruvian border

Philippines
  Philippines claims sovereignty over Scarborough Reef
  (also claimed by China together with Taiwan) and over certain of the
  Spratly Islands, known locally as the Kalayaan (Freedom) Islands,
  also claimed by China, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam; the 2002
  "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea," has
  eased tensions in the Spratly Islands but falls short of a legally
  binding "code of conduct" desired by several of the disputants; in
  March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the Philippines,
  and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine seismic
  activities in the Spratly Islands; Philippines retains a dormant
  claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo based on the
  Sultanate of Sulu's granting the Philippines Government power of
  attorney to pursue a sovereignty claim on his behalf; maritime
  delimitation negotiations continue with Palau

Pitcairn Islands
  none

Poland
  as a member state that forms part of the EU's external
  border, Poland has implemented the strict Schengen border rules to
  restrict illegal immigration and trade along its eastern borders
  with Belarus and Ukraine

Portugal
  Portugal does not recognize Spanish sovereignty over the
  territory of Olivenza based on a difference of interpretation of the
  1815 Congress of Vienna and the 1801 Treaty of Badajoz

Romania
  the ICJ gave Ukraine until December 2006 to reply, and
  Romania until June 2007 to issue a rejoinder, in their dispute
  submitted in 2004 over Ukrainian-administered Zmiyinyy/Serpilor
  (Snake) Island and Black Sea maritime boundary delimitation; Romania
  also opposes Ukraine's reopening of a navigation canal from the
  Danube border through Ukraine to the Black Sea

Russia
  China and Russia have demarcated the once disputed islands at
  the Amur and Ussuri confluence and in the Argun River in accordance
  with the 2004 Agreement, ending their centuries-long border
  disputes; the sovereignty dispute over the islands of Etorofu,
  Kunashiri, Shikotan, and the Habomai group, known in Japan as the
  "Northern Territories" and in Russia as the "Southern Kurils,"
  occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945, now administered by Russia,
  and claimed by Japan, remains the primary sticking point to signing
  a peace treaty formally ending World War II hostilities; Russia and
  Georgia agree on delimiting all but small, strategic segments of the
  land boundary and the maritime boundary; OSCE observers monitor
  volatile areas such as the Pankisi Gorge in the Akhmeti region and
  the Kodori Gorge in Abkhazia; Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Russia
  signed equidistance boundaries in the Caspian seabed but the
  littoral states have no consensus on dividing the water column;
  Russia and Norway reached an agreement on how to align Barents Sea
  and Arctic Ocean boundaries over EEZ and continental shelf in an
  agreement signed on 15 September 2010; this agreement is pending
  ratification by the respective national assemblies; various groups
  in Finland advocate restoration of Karelia (Kareliya) and other
  areas ceded to the Soviet Union following the Second World War but
  the Finnish Government asserts no territorial demands; in May 2005,
  Russia recalled its signatures to the 1996 border agreements with
  Estonia (1996) and Latvia (1997), when the two Baltic states
  announced issuance of unilateral declarations referencing Soviet
  occupation and ensuing territorial losses; Russia demands better
  treatment of ethnic Russians in Estonia and Latvia; Estonian citizen
  groups continue to press for realignment of the boundary based on
  the 1920 Tartu Peace Treaty that would bring the now divided ethnic
  Setu people and parts of the Narva region within Estonia; Lithuania
  and Russia committed to demarcating their boundary in 2006 in
  accordance with the land and maritime treaty ratified by Russia in
  May 2003 and by Lithuania in 1999; Lithuania operates a simplified
  transit regime for Russian nationals traveling from the Kaliningrad
  coastal exclave into Russia, while still conforming, as an EU member
  state with an EU external border, where strict Schengen border rules
  apply; preparations for the demarcation delimitation of land
  boundary with Ukraine have commenced; the dispute over the boundary
  between Russia and Ukraine through the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov
  remains unresolved despite a December 2003 framework agreement and
  on-going expert-level discussions; Kazakhstan and Russia boundary
  delimitation was ratified on November 2005 and field demarcation
  should commence in 2007; Russian Duma has not yet ratified 1990
  Bering Sea Maritime Boundary Agreement with the US

Rwanda
  fighting among ethnic groups - loosely associated political
  rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces in Great Lakes
  region transcending the boundaries of Burundi, Democratic Republic
  of the Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda - abated substantially from a
  decade ago due largely to UN peacekeeping, international mediation,
  and efforts by local governments to create civil societies;
  nonetheless, 57,000 Rwandan refugees still reside in 21 African
  states, including Zambia, Gabon, and 20,000 who fled to Burundi in
  2005 and 2006 to escape drought and recriminations from traditional
  courts investigating the 1994 massacres; the 2005 DROC and Rwanda
  border verification mechanism to stem rebel actions on both sides of
  the border remains in place

  with Yemen to stem illegal cross-border activities; Kuwait and Saudi
  Arabia continue discussions on a maritime boundary with Iran; Saudi
  Arabia claims Egyptian-administered islands of Tiran and Sanafir

Senegal
  The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau attempt to stem separatist
  violence, cross border raids, and arms smuggling into their
  countries from Senegal's Casamance region, and in 2006, respectively
  accepted 6,000 and 10,000 Casamance residents fleeing the conflict;
  2,500 Guinea-Bissau residents fled into Senegal in 2006 to escape
  armed confrontations along the border

Serbia
  Serbia with several other states protest the U.S. and other
  states' recognition of Kosovo's declaring itself as a sovereign and
  independent state in February 2008; ethnic Serbian municipalities
  along Kosovo's northern border challenge final status of
  Kosovo-Serbia boundary; several thousand NATO-led KFOR peacekeepers
  under UNMIK authority continue to keep the peace within Kosovo
  between the ethnic Albanian majority and the Serb minority in
  Kosovo; Serbia delimited about half of the boundary with Bosnia and
  Herzegovina, but sections along the Drina River remain in dispute

Seychelles
  together with Mauritius, Seychelles claims the Chagos
  Archipelago (UK-administered British Indian Ocean Territory)

Sierra Leone
  as domestic fighting among disparate ethnic groups,
  rebel groups, warlords, and youth gangs in Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea,
  Liberia, and Sierra Leone gradually abates, the number of refugees
  in border areas has begun to slowly dwindle; Sierra Leone considers
  excessive Guinea's definition of the flood plain limits to define
  the left bank boundary of the Makona and Moa rivers and protests
  Guinea's continued occupation of these lands including the hamlet of
  Yenga occupied since 1998

Singapore
  disputes persist with Malaysia over deliveries of fresh
  water to Singapore, Singapore's extensive land reclamation works,
  bridge construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and
  Singapore Straits; in 2008, ICJ awards sovereignty of Pedra Branca
  (Pulau Batu Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks
  to Malaysia, but does not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or
  disposition of South Ledge; Indonesia and Singapore continue to work
  on finalization of their 1973 maritime boundary agreement by
  defining unresolved areas north of Indonesia's Batam Island; piracy
  remains a problem in the Malacca Strait

Slovakia
  bilateral government, legal, technical and economic working
  group negotiations continued in 2006 between Slovakia and Hungary
  over Hungary's completion of its portion of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros
  hydroelectric dam project along the Danube; as a member state that
  forms part of the EU's external border, Slovakia has implemented the
  strict Schengen border rules

Slovenia
  the Croatia-Slovenia land and maritime boundary agreement,
  which would have ceded most of Piran Bay and maritime access to
  Slovenia and several villages to Croatia, remains unratified and in
  dispute; Slovenia also protests Croatia's 2003 claim to an exclusive
  economic zone in the Adriatic; as a member state that forms part of
  the EU's external border, Slovenia has implemented the strict
  Schengen border rules to curb illegal migration and commerce through
  southeastern Europe while encouraging close cross-border ties with
  Croatia

Solomon Islands
  since 2003, RAMSI, consisting of police, military,
  and civilian advisors drawn from 15 countries, has assisted in
  reestablishing and maintaining civil and political order while
  reinforcing regional stability and security

Somalia
  Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia and routed
  Islamist Courts from Mogadishu in January 2007; "Somaliland"
  secessionists provide port facilities in Berbera to landlocked
  Ethiopia and have established commercial ties with other regional
  states; "Puntland" and "Somaliland" "governments" seek international
  support in their secessionist aspirations and overlapping border
  claims; the undemarcated former British administrative line has
  little meaning as a political separation to rival clans within
  Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern Somalia's Oromo region; Kenya works
  hard to prevent the clan and militia fighting in Somalia from
  spreading south across the border, which has long been open to
  nomadic pastoralists

South Africa
  South Africa has placed military along the border to
  apprehend the thousands of Zimbabweans fleeing economic dysfunction
  and political persecution; as of January 2007, South Africa also
  supports large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers from the
  Democratic Republic of the Congo (33,000), Somalia (20,000), Burundi
  (6,500), and other states in Africa (26,000); managed dispute with
  Namibia over the location of the boundary in the Orange River; in
  2006, Swazi king advocates resort to ICJ to claim parts of
  Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal from South Africa

South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands
  Argentina, which claims the
  islands in its constitution and briefly occupied them by force in
  1982, agreed in 1995 to no longer seek settlement by force

Southern Ocean
  Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctica
  entry), but Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, NZ, Norway, and UK
  assert claims (some overlapping), including the continental shelf in
  the Southern Ocean; several states have expressed an interest in
  extending those continental shelf claims under the United Nations
  Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to include undersea
  ridges; the US and most other states do not recognize the land or
  maritime claims of other states and have made no claims themselves
  (the US and Russia have reserved the right to do so); no formal
  claims exist in the waters in the sector between 90 degrees west and
  150 degrees west

Spain
  in 2002, Gibraltar residents voted overwhelmingly by
  referendum to reject any "shared sovereignty" arrangement; the
  government of Gibraltar insists on equal participation in talks
  between the UK and Spain; Spain disapproves of UK plans to grant
  Gibraltar greater autonomy; Morocco protests Spain's control over
  the coastal enclaves of Ceuta, Melilla, and the islands of Penon de
  Velez de la Gomera, Penon de Alhucemas, and Islas Chafarinas, and
  surrounding waters; both countries claim Isla Perejil (Leila
  Island); Morocco serves as the primary launching site of illegal
  migration into Spain from North Africa; Portugal does not recognize
  Spanish sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza based on a
  difference of interpretation of the 1815 Congress of Vienna and the
  1801 Treaty of Badajoz

Spratly Islands
  all of the Spratly Islands are claimed by China
  (including Taiwan) and Vietnam; parts of them are claimed by Brunei,
  Malaysia and the Philippines; despite no public territorial claim to
  Louisa Reef, Brunei implicitly lays claim by including it within the
  natural prolongation of its continental shelf and basis for a seabed
  median with Vietnam; claimants in November 2002 signed the
  "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea,"
  which has eased tensions but falls short of a legally binding "code
  of conduct"; in March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the
  Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine
  seismic activities in the Spratly Islands

Sri Lanka
  none

Sudan
  the effects of Sudan's almost constant ethnic and rebel
  militia fighting since the mid-20th century have penetrated all of
  the neighboring states; as of 2006, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Central
  African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda
  provided shelter for over half a million Sudanese refugees, which
  includes 240,000 Darfur residents driven from their homes by
  Janjawid armed militia and the Sudanese military forces; Sudan, in
  turn, hosted about 116,000 Eritreans, 20,000 Chadians, and smaller
  numbers of Ethiopians, Ugandans, Central Africans, and Congolese as
  refugees; in February 2006, Sudan and DROC signed an agreement to
  repatriate 13,300 Sudanese and 6,800 Congolese; Sudan accuses
  Eritrea of supporting Sudanese rebel groups; efforts to demarcate
  the porous boundary with Ethiopia proceed slowly due to civil and
  ethnic fighting in eastern Sudan; the boundary that separates Kenya
  and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi Triangle," which
  Kenya has administered since colonial times; Sudan claims but Egypt
  de facto administers security and economic development of Halaib
  region north of the 22nd parallel boundary; periodic violent
  skirmishes with Sudanese residents over water and grazing rights
  persist among related pastoral populations along the border with the
  Central African Republic

Suriname
  area claimed by French Guiana between Riviere Litani and
  Riviere Marouini (both headwaters of the Lawa); Suriname claims a
  triangle of land between the New and Kutari/Koetari rivers in a
  historic dispute over the headwaters of the Courantyne; Guyana seeks
  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) arbitration
  to resolve the long-standing dispute with Suriname over the axis of
  the territorial sea boundary in potentially oil-rich waters

Svalbard
  despite recent discussions, Russia and Norway dispute their

Syria
  Golan Heights is Israeli-occupied with the almost 1,000-strong
  UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) patrolling a buffer zone
  since 1964; lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the
  boundary, portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with
  several sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a
  Farms in the Golan Heights; 2004 Agreement and pending demarcation
  settles border dispute with Jordan; approximately two million Iraqis
  have fled the conflict in Iraq with the majority taking refuge in
  Syria and Jordan

Taiwan
  involved in complex dispute with Brunei, China, Malaysia, the
  Philippines, and Vietnam over the Spratly Islands, and with China
  and the Philippines over Scarborough Reef; the 2002 "Declaration on
  the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions
  but falls short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by
  several of the disputants; Paracel Islands are occupied by China,
  but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam; in 2003, China and Taiwan became
  more vocal in rejecting both Japan's claims to the uninhabited
  islands of the Senkaku-shoto (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's unilaterally
  declared exclusive economic zone in the East China Sea where all
  parties engage in hydrocarbon prospecting

Tajikistan
  in 2006, China and Tajikistan pledged to commence
  demarcation of the revised boundary agreed to in the delimitation of
  2002; talks continue with Uzbekistan to delimit border and remove
  minefields; disputes in Isfara Valley delay delimitation with
  Kyrgyzstan

Tanzania
  Tanzania still hosts more than a half-million refugees,
  more than any other African country, mainly from Burundi and the
  Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite the international
  community's efforts at repatriation; disputes with Malawi over the
  boundary in Lake Nyasa (Lake Malawi) and the meandering Songwe River
  remain dormant

Thailand
  separatist violence in Thailand's predominantly Muslim
  southern provinces prompt border closures and controls with Malaysia
  to stem terrorist activities; Southeast Asian states have enhanced
  border surveillance to check the spread of avian flu; talks continue
  on completion of demarcation with Laos but disputes remain over
  several islands in the Mekong River; despite continuing border
  committee talks, Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic
  rebels, refugees, and illegal cross-border activities, and as of
  2006, over 116,000 Karen, Hmong, and other refugees and asylum
  seekers from Burma; Cambodia and Thailand dispute sections of
  historic boundary with missing boundary markers; Cambodia claims
  Thai encroachments into Cambodian territory and obstructing access
  to Preah Vihear temple ruins awarded to Cambodia by ICJ decision in
  1962; Thailand is studying the feasibility of jointly constructing
  the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween river near the border with Burma; in
  2004, international environmentalist pressure prompted China to halt
  construction of 13 dams on the Salween River that flows through
  China, Burma, and Thailand

Timor-Leste
  Timor-Leste-Indonesia Boundary Committee has resolved
  all but some sections of border along Timor-Leste's Oecussi exclave;
  maritime boundaries with Indonesia remain unresolved; many refugees
  who left Timor-Leste in 2003 still reside in Indonesia and refuse
  repatriation; in 2007, Australia and Timor-Leste signed a 50-year
  development zone and revenue sharing agreement in lieu of a maritime
  boundary

Togo
  in 2001, Benin claimed Togo moved boundary monuments - joint
  commission continues to resurvey the boundary; in 2006, 14,000
  Togolese refugees remain in Benin and Ghana out of the 40,000 who
  fled there in 2005

Trinidad and Tobago
  in April 2006, the Permanent Court of
  Arbitration issued a decision that delimited a maritime boundary
  with Trinidad and Tobago and compelled Barbados to enter a fishing
  agreement that limited Barbadian fishermen's catches of flying fish
  in Trinidad and Tobago's exclusive economic zone; in 2005, Barbados
  and Trinidad and Tobago agreed to compulsory international
  arbitration under UNCLOS challenging whether the northern limit of
  Trinidad and Tobago's and Venezuela's maritime boundary extends into
  Barbadian waters; Guyana has also expressed its intention to include
  itself in the arbitration as the Trinidad and Tobago-Venezuela
  maritime boundary may extend into its waters as well

  cotton monoculture in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan
  creates water-sharing difficulties for Amu Darya river states; field
  demarcation of the boundaries with Kazakhstan commenced in 2005, but
  Caspian seabed delimitation remains stalled with Azerbaijan, Iran,
  and Kazakhstan due to Turkmenistan's indecision over how to allocate
  the sea's waters and seabed

  refugees as well as members of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) seek
  shelter in southern Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's
  Garamba National Park; LRA forces have also attacked Kenyan villages
  across the border

Ukraine
  1997 boundary delimitation treaty with Belarus remains
  un-ratified due to unresolved financial claims, stalling demarcation
  and reducing border security; delimitation of land boundary with
  Russia is complete with preparations for demarcation underway; the
  dispute over the boundary between Russia and Ukraine through the
  Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov remains unresolved despite a December
  2003 framework agreement and ongoing expert-level discussions;
  Moldova and Ukraine operate joint customs posts to monitor transit
  of people and commodities through Moldova's break-away Transnistria
  Region, which remains under OSCE supervision; the ICJ gave Ukraine

  of UK plans to grant Gibraltar greater autonomy; Mauritius and
  Seychelles claim the Chagos Archipelago (British Indian Ocean
  Territory), and its former inhabitants since their eviction in 1965;
  most Chagossians reside in Mauritius, and in 2001 were granted UK
  citizenship, where some have since resettled; in May 2006, the High
  Court of London reversed the UK Government's 2004 orders of council
  that banned habitation on the islands; UK rejects sovereignty talks
  requested by Argentina, which still claims the Falkland Islands
  (Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands;
  territorial claim in Antarctica (British Antarctic Territory)
  overlaps Argentine claim and partially overlaps Chilean claim;
  Iceland, the UK, and Ireland dispute Denmark's claim that the Faroe
  Islands' continental shelf extends beyond 200 nm

United States
  the U.S. has intensified domestic security measures
  and is collaborating closely with its neighbors, Canada and Mexico,
  to monitor and control legal and illegal personnel, transport, and
  commodities across the international borders; abundant rainfall in
  recent years along much of the Mexico-US border region has
  ameliorated periodically strained water-sharing arrangements; 1990
  Maritime Boundary Agreement in the Bering Sea still awaits Russian
  Duma ratification; managed maritime boundary disputes with Canada at
  Dixon Entrance, Beaufort Sea, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and around the
  disputed Machias Seal Island and North Rock; The Bahamas and US have
  not been able to agree on a maritime boundary; US Naval Base at
  Guantanamo Bay is leased from Cuba and only mutual agreement or US
  abandonment of the area can terminate the lease; Haiti claims
  US-administered Navassa Island; US has made no territorial claim in
  Antarctica (but has reserved the right to do so) and does not
  recognize the claims of any other states; Marshall Islands claims
  Wake Island; Tokelau included American Samoa's Swains Island among
  the islands listed in its 2006 draft constitution

United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges
  none

Uruguay
  in Jan 2007, ICJ provisionally ruled Uruguay may begin
  construction of two paper mills on the Uruguay River, which forms
  the border with Argentina, while the court examines further whether
  Argentina has the legal right to stop such construction with
  potential environmental implications to both countries; two
  uncontested boundary disputes with Brazil over Isla Brasilera at the
  tripoint with Argentina at the confluence of the Quarai/Cuareim and
  Uruguay rivers, and, in the 235 square kilometer Invernada River
  region, over which tributary represents the legitimate source of the
  Quarai/Cuareim River

Uzbekistan
  prolonged drought and cotton monoculture in Uzbekistan
  and Turkmenistan creates water-sharing difficulties for Amu Darya
  river states; field demarcation of the boundaries with Kazakhstan
  commenced in 2004; border delimitation of 130 km of border with
  Kyrgyzstan is hampered by serious disputes around enclaves and other
  areas

Vanuatu
  Matthew and Hunter Islands east of New Caledonia claimed by
  Vanuatu and France

Venezuela
  claims all of the area west of the Essequibo River in
  Guyana, preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has
  expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before
  the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that
  Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela extends into
  their waters; dispute with Colombia over maritime boundary and
  Venezuelan-administered Los Monjes islands near the Gulf of
  Venezuela; Colombian-organized illegal narcotics and paramilitary
  activities penetrate Venezuela's shared border region; in 2006, an
  estimated 139,000 Colombians sought protection in 150 communities
  along the border in Venezuela; US, France, and the Netherlands
  recognize Venezuela's granting full effect to Aves Island, thereby
  claiming a Venezuelan EEZ/continental shelf extending over a large
  portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea; Dominica, Saint Kitts and
  Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines protest
  Venezuela's full effect claim

Vietnam
  southeast Asian states have enhanced border surveillance to
  check the spread of avian flu; Cambodia and Laos protest Vietnamese
  squatters and armed encroachments along border; an estimated 300,000
  Vietnamese refugees reside in China; establishment of a maritime
  boundary with Cambodia is hampered by unresolved dispute over the
  sovereignty of offshore islands; the decade-long demarcation of the
  China-Vietnam land boundary was completed in 2009; China occupies
  the Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan; involved in
  complex dispute with Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, and
  Taiwan over the Spratly Islands; the 2002 "Declaration on the
  Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea" has eased tensions but
  falls short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by
  several of the disputants; Vietnam continues to expand construction
  of facilities in the Spratly Islands; in March 2005, the national
  oil companies of China, the Philippines, and Vietnam signed a joint
  accord to conduct marine seismic activities in the Spratly Islands

Virgin Islands
  none

Wake Island
  claimed by Marshall Islands

Wallis and Futuna
  none

West Bank
  West Bank and Gaza Strip are Israeli-occupied with current
  status subject to the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement -
  permanent status to be determined through further negotiation;
  Israel continues construction of a "seam line" separation barrier
  along parts of the Green Line and within the West Bank; Israel
  withdrew from four settlements in the northern West Bank in August
  2005; since 1948, about 350 peacekeepers from the UN Truce
  Supervision Organization (UNTSO), headquartered in Jerusalem,
  monitor ceasefires, supervise armistice agreements, prevent isolated
  incidents from escalating, and assist other UN personnel in the
  region

Western Sahara
  Morocco claims and administers Western Sahara, whose
  sovereignty remains unresolved; UN-administered cease-fire has
  remained in effect since September 1991, administered by the UN
  Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), but attempts
  to hold a referendum have failed and parties thus far have rejected
  all brokered proposals; several states have extended diplomatic
  relations to the "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic" represented by
  the Polisario Front in exile in Algeria, while others recognize
  Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara; most of the approximately
  102,000 Sahrawi refugees are sheltered in camps in Tindouf, Algeria

World
  stretching over 250,000 km, the world's 322 international land
  boundaries separate 194 independent states and 71 dependencies,
  areas of special sovereignty, and other miscellaneous entities;
  ethnicity, culture, race, religion, and language have divided states
  into separate political entities as much as history, physical
  terrain, political fiat, or conquest, resulting in sometimes
  arbitrary and imposed boundaries; most maritime states have claimed
  limits that include territorial seas and exclusive economic zones;
  overlapping limits due to adjacent or opposite coasts create the
  potential for 430 bilateral maritime boundaries of which 209 have
  agreements that include contiguous and non-contiguous segments;
  boundary, borderland/resource, and territorial disputes vary in
  intensity from managed or dormant to violent or militarized;
  undemarcated, indefinite, porous, and unmanaged boundaries tend to
  encourage illegal cross-border activities, uncontrolled migration,
  and confrontation; territorial disputes may evolve from historical
  and/or cultural claims, or they may be brought on by resource
  competition; ethnic and cultural clashes continue to be responsible
  for much of the territorial fragmentation and internal displacement
  of the estimated 6.6 million people and cross-border displacements
  of 8.6 million refugees around the world as of early 2006; just over
  one million refugees were repatriated in the same period; other
  sources of contention include access to water and mineral
  (especially hydrocarbon) resources, fisheries, and arable land;
  armed conflict prevails not so much between the uniformed armed
  forces of independent states as between stateless armed entities
  that detract from the sustenance and welfare of local populations,
  leaving the community of nations to cope with resultant refugees,
  hunger, disease, impoverishment, and environmental degradation

Yemen
  Saudi Arabia has reinforced its concrete-filled security
  barrier along sections of the fully demarcated border with Yemen to
  stem illegal cross-border activities

Zambia
  in 2004, Zimbabwe dropped objections to plans between
  Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi River,
  thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly delimited,
  Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river

Zimbabwe
  Botswana built electric fences and South Africa has placed
  military along the border to stem the flow of thousands of
  Zimbabweans fleeing to find work and escape political persecution;
  Namibia has supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections to,
  plans between Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi
  River, thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly
  delimited, Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river
