Field Listing :: Trafficking in persons

  Trafficking in persons is modern-day slavery, involving victims who
  are forced, defrauded, or coerced into labor or sexual exploitation.
  The International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN agency charged
  with addressing labor standards, employment, and social protection
  issues, estimates that 12.3 million people worldwide are enslaved in
  forced labor, bonded labor, forced child labor, sexual servitude,
  and involuntary servitude at any given time. Human trafficking is a
  multi-dimensional threat, depriving people of their human rights and
  freedoms, risking global health, promoting social breakdown,
  inhibiting development by depriving countries of their human
  capital, and helping fuel the growth of organized crime. In 2000,
  the US Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act
  (TVPA), reauthorized in 2003 and 2005, which provides tools for the
  US to combat trafficking in persons, both domestically and abroad.
  One of the law's key components is the creation of the US Department
  of State's annual Trafficking in Persons Report, which assesses the
  government response (i.e., the current situation) in some 150
  countries with a significant number of victims trafficked across
  their borders who are recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or
  obtained for forced labor or sexual exploitation. Countries in the
  annual report are rated in three tiers, based on government efforts
  to combat trafficking. The countries identified in this entry are
  those listed in the 2010 Trafficking in Persons Report as Tier 2
  Watch List or Tier 3 based on the following tier rating definitions:
  Tier 2 Watch List countries do not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking but are making
  significant efforts to do so, and meet one of the following criteria:
  1. they display high or significantly increasing number of victims,
  2. they have failed to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat trafficking in persons, or,
  3. they have committed to take action over the next year.
  Tier 3 countries neither satisfy the minimum standards for the
  elimination of trafficking nor demonstrate a significant effort to
  do so. Countries in this tier are subject to potential
  non-humanitarian and non-trade sanctions.
  Country


  Trafficking in persons

Algeria
  current situation: Algeria is a transit country for men and
  women trafficked from sub-Saharan Africa to Europe for the purposes
  of commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude;
  criminal networks of sub-Saharan nationals in southern Algeria
  facilitate transit by arranging transportation, forged documents,
  and promises of employment
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Algeria is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List because it does not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking, however, it is making
  significant efforts to do so; in January 2009, the government
  approved new legislation that criminalizes trafficking in persons
  for the purposes of labor and sexual exploitation representing an
  important step toward complying with international standards;
  despite these efforts, the government did not show overall progress
  in punishing trafficking crimes and protecting trafficking victims
  and continued to lack adequate measures to protect victims and
  prevent trafficking (2009)

Azerbaijan
  current situation: Azerbaijan is primarily a source and
  transit country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; women
  and some children from Azerbaijan are trafficked to Turkey and the
  UAE for the purpose of sexual exploitation; men and boys are
  trafficked to Russia for the purpose of forced labor; Azerbaijan
  serves as a transit country for victims from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
  Kazakhstan, and Moldova trafficked to Turkey and the UAE for sexual
  exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Azerbaijan is on the Tier 2 Watch
  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat trafficking in persons, particularly efforts to investigate,
  prosecute, and punish traffickers; to address complicity among law
  enforcement personnel; and to adequately identify and protect
  victims in Azerbaijan; the government has yet to develop a
  much-needed mechanism to identify potential trafficking victims and
  refer them to safety and care; poor treatment of trafficking victims
  in courtrooms continues to be a problem (2008)

Bangladesh
  current situation: Bangladesh is a source and transit
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; a significant share
  of Bangladesh's trafficking victims are men recruited for work
  overseas with fraudulent employment offers who are subsequently
  exploited under conditions of forced labor or debt bondage; children
  are trafficked within Bangladesh for commercial sexual exploitation,
  bonded labor, and forced labor; women and children from Bangladesh
  are also trafficked to India and Pakistan for sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Bangladesh is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it
  does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination
  of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so,
  including some progress in addressing sex trafficking; the
  government did not demonstrate sufficient progress in criminally
  prosecuting and convicting labor trafficking offenders, particularly
  those responsible for the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for the
  purpose of labor trafficking (2009)

Belize
  current situation: Belize is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; the
  most common form of trafficking in Belize is the internal sex
  trafficking of minors; some Central American men, women, and
  children, particularly from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador,
  migrate voluntarily to Belize in search of work but are subsequently
  subjected to conditions of forced labor or forced prostitution
  tier rating: Belize is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it does
  not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;
  despite efforts to raise public awareness of human trafficking and
  provide protection services for trafficking victims, the government
  did not show evidence of progress in convicting and sentencing
  trafficking offenders last year (2009)

Burma
  current situation: Burma is a source country for women,
  children, and men trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and
  commercial sexual exploitation; Burmese women and children are
  trafficked to East and Southeast Asia for commercial sexual
  exploitation, domestic servitude, and forced labor; Burmese children
  are subjected to conditions of forced labor in Thailand as hawkers
  and beggars; women are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation
  to Malaysia and China; some trafficking victims transit Burma from
  Bangladesh to Malaysia and from China to Thailand; Burma's internal
  trafficking remains the most serious concern occurring primarily
  from villages to urban centers and economic hubs for labor in
  industrial zones, agricultural estates, and commercial sexual
  exploitation; the Burmese military continues to engage in the
  unlawful conscription of child soldiers, and continues to be the
  main perpetrator of forced labor inside Burma; ethnic insurgent
  groups also used compulsory labor of adults and unlawful recruitment
  of children; the regime's widespread use of and lack of
  accountability in forced labor and recruitment of child soldiers is
  particularly worrying and represents the top causal factor for
  Burma's significant trafficking problem
  tier rating: Tier 3 - serious problems remain in Burma, and in some
  areas, most notably in the area of forced labor, the Government of
  Burma is not making significant efforts to comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking, warranting a ranking
  of Tier 3; in other areas, particularly with regard to international
  sex trafficking of women and girls, the Government of Burma is
  making significant efforts (2010)

Cameroon
  current situation: Cameroon is a source, transit, and
  destination country for women and children trafficked for the
  purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; most
  victims are children trafficked within country, with girls primarily
  trafficked for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation; both boys
  and girls are also trafficked within Cameroon for forced labor in
  sweatshops, bars, restaurants, and on tea and cocoa plantations;
  children are trafficked into Cameroon from neighboring states for
  forced labor in agriculture, fishing, street vending, and
  spare-parts shops; Cameroon is a transit country for children
  trafficked between Gabon and Nigeria, and from Nigeria to Saudi
  Arabia; it is a source country for women transported by
  sex-trafficking rings to Europe
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cameroon is on the Tier 2 Watch
  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat human trafficking in 2007, particularly in terms of efforts
  to prosecute and convict trafficking offenders; while Cameroon
  reported some arrests of traffickers, none of them were prosecuted
  or punished; the government does not identify trafficking victims
  among vulnerable populations nor does it monitor the number of
  victims it intercepts (2008)

Central African Republic
  current situation: Central African Republic
  is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and
  children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual
  exploitation; the majority of victims are children trafficked within
  the country for sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, street
  vending, and forced agricultural, mine, market and restaurant labor;
  to a lesser extent, children are trafficked from the Central African
  Republic to Cameroon, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo;
  rebels conscript children into armed forces within the country
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Central African Republic is on the
  Tier 2 Watch List for the third consecutive year for its failure to
  show evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in 2007;
  efforts to address trafficking through vigorous law enforcement
  measures and victim protection efforts were minimal, though
  awareness about trafficking appeared to be increasing in the
  country; the government does not actively investigate cases, work to
  identify trafficking victims among vulnerable populations, or rescue
  and provide care to victims; the government has not taken measures
  to reduce demand for commercial sex acts (2008)

Chad
  current situation: Chad is a source, transit, and destination
  country for children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and
  commercial sexual exploitation; the majority of children are
  trafficked within Chad for involuntary domestic servitude, forced
  cattle herding, forced begging, forced labor in petty commerce or
  the fishing industry, or for commercial sexual exploitation; to a
  lesser extent, Chadian children are also trafficked to Cameroon, the
  Central African Republic, and Nigeria for cattle herding; children
  may also be trafficked from Cameroon and the Central African
  Republic to Chad's oil producing regions for sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Chad does not
  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking and is not making any significant efforts to do so;
  although facing resource constraints, the government has the
  capacity to conduct basic anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts,
  yet did not do so during the last year; it showed no results in
  enforcing government policy prohibiting the recruitment of child
  soldiers; Chad has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2009)

China
  current situation: China is a source, transit, and destination
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  sexual exploitation and forced labor; the majority of trafficking in
  China occurs within the country's borders, but there is also
  considerable international trafficking of Chinese citizens to
  Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and North
  America; Chinese women are lured abroad through false promises of
  legitimate employment, only to be forced into commercial sexual
  exploitation, largely in Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan;
  women and children are trafficked to China from Mongolia, Burma,
  North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam for forced labor, marriage, and
  prostitution; some North Korean women and children seeking to leave
  their country voluntarily cross the border into China and are then
  sold into prostitution, marriage, or forced labor
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - China is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for the fourth consecutive year for its failure to provide evidence
  of increasing efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly in
  terms of punishment of trafficking crimes and the protection of
  Chinese and foreign victims of trafficking; victims are sometimes
  punished for unlawful acts that were committed as a direct result of
  their being trafficked, such as violations of prostitution or
  immigration/emigration controls; the Chinese Government continued to
  treat North Korean victims of trafficking solely as economic
  migrants, routinely deporting them back to horrendous conditions in
  North Korea; additional challenges facing the Chinese Government
  include the enormous size of its trafficking problem and the
  significant level of corruption and complicity in trafficking by
  some local government officials (2008)

Congo, Democratic Republic of the
  current situation: Democratic
  Republic of the Congo is a source and destination country for men,
  women, and children subjected to trafficking for the purposes of
  forced labor and forced prostitution; the majority of this
  trafficking is internal, and much of it is perpetrated by armed
  groups and government forces outside government control within the
  country's unstable eastern provinces
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Government of the Democratic Republic of the
  Congo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the
  elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to
  do so; the government did not show evidence of progress in
  prosecuting and punishing labor or sex trafficking offenders,
  including members of its own armed forces; providing protective
  services for the vast majority of trafficking victims; or raising
  public awareness of human trafficking; in addition, the government's
  anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts decreased during the
  reporting period (2010)

Congo, Republic of the
  current situation: Republic of the Congo is a
  source and destination country for children trafficked for the
  purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; girls
  are trafficked from rural areas within the country for commercial
  sexual exploitation, forced street vending, and domestic servitude;
  children are trafficked from other African countries for domestic
  servitude, forced market vending, and forced labor in the fishing
  industry
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Republic of the Congo is on the
  Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to show evidence of increasing
  efforts to combat trafficking in persons in 2007; struggling to
  recover from six years of civil conflict that ended in 2003, the
  Republic of the Congo's capacity to address trafficking is
  handicapped; the government neither monitors its borders for
  trafficking activity nor provides specialized anti-trafficking
  training for law enforcement officials; the government does not
  encourage victims to assist in trafficking investigations or
  prosecutions, and has not taken measures to reduce demand for
  commercial sex acts in the Republic of the Congo (2008)

Cote d'Ivoire
  Cote d'Ivoire is a source, transit, and destination
  country for women and children trafficked for forced labor and
  commercial sexual exploitation; trafficking within the country is
  more prevalent than international trafficking and the majority of
  victims are children; women and girls are trafficked from northern
  areas to southern cities for domestic servitude, restaurant labor,
  and sexual exploitation; boys are trafficked internally for
  agricultural and service labor and transnationally for forced labor
  in agriculture, mining, construction, and in the fishing industry;
  women and girls are trafficked to and from other West and Central
  African countries for domestic servitude and forced street vending
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Cote d'Ivoire is on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to eliminate trafficking in 2007, particularly with regard to its
  law enforcement efforts and protection of sex trafficking victims;
  in addition, Ivoirian law does not prohibit all forms of
  trafficking, and Cote d'Ivoire has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
  Protocol (2008)

Cuba
  current situation: Cuba is principally a source country for
  children subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically
  commercial sexual exploitation within the country; the scope of
  trafficking within Cuba is difficult to gauge due to the closed
  nature of the government and sparse non-governmental or independent
  reporting
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
  significant efforts to do so; in a positive step, the Government of
  Cuba shared information about human trafficking and its efforts to
  address the issue; the government did not prohibit all forms of
  trafficking during the reporting period, nor did it provide specific
  evidence that it prosecuted and punished trafficking offenders,
  protected victims of all forms of trafficking, or implemented victim
  protection policies or programs to prevent human trafficking (2010)

Dominican Republic
  current situation: the Dominican Republic is a
  source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and
  children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual
  exploitation and forced labor; a large number of Dominican women are
  trafficked into prostitution and sexual exploitation in Western
  Europe, Australia, Central and South America, and Caribbean
  destinations; a significant number of women, boys, and girls are
  trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation and domestic
  servitude
  tier rating: Tier 3 - for its failure to show evidence of increasing
  efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly in terms of not
  adequately investigating and prosecuting public officials who may be
  complicit with trafficking activity, and inadequate government
  efforts to protect trafficking victims; the government has taken
  measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts with children
  through criminal prosecutions (2008)

Equatorial Guinea
  current situation: Equatorial Guinea is primarily
  a destination country for children trafficked for the purpose of
  forced labor and possibly for the purpose of sexual exploitation;
  children have been trafficked from nearby countries for domestic
  servitude, market labor, ambulant vending, and possibly sexual
  exploitation; women may also be trafficked to Equatorial Guinea from
  Cameroon, Benin, other neighboring countries, and China for sexual
  exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Equatorial Guinea is on the Tier 2
  Watch List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts
  to eliminate trafficking, particularly in the areas of prosecuting
  and convicting trafficking offenders and failing to formalize
  mechanisms to provide assistance to victims; although the government
  made some effort to enforce laws against child labor exploitation,
  it failed to report any trafficking prosecutions or convictions in
  2007; the government continued to lack shelters or formal procedures
  for providing care to victims (2008)

Eritrea
  current situation: Eritrea is a source country for men,
  women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and
  commercial sexual exploitation; each year, large numbers of migrant
  workers depart Eritrea in search of work, particularly in the Gulf
  States, where some likely become victims of forced labor, including
  in domestic servitude, or commercial sexual exploitation; thousands
  of Eritreans flee the country illegally, mostly to Sudan, Ethiopia,
  and Kenya where their illegal status makes them vulnerable to
  situations of human trafficking; the government remains complicit in
  conscripting children into military service
  tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Eritrea does not fully
  comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
  and is not making significant efforts to do so; the Eritrean
  government does not operate with transparency and published neither
  data nor statistics regarding its efforts to combat human
  trafficking; it did not respond to requests to provide information
  for this report; the government made no known progress in
  prosecuting and punishing trafficking crimes over the reporting
  period and did not appear to provide any significant assistance to
  victims of trafficking during the reporting period (2009)

Fiji
  current situation: Fiji is a source country for children
  trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation and a
  destination country for a small number of women from China and India
  trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual
  exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Fiji does not fully comply with the
  minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
  making significant efforts to do so; the government has demonstrated
  no action to investigate or prosecute traffickers, assist victims,
  take steps to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts, or support
  any anti-trafficking information or education campaigns; Fiji has
  not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2009)

Gabon
  current situation: Gabon is predominantly a destination
  country for children trafficked from other African countries for the

  sexual exploitation, while boys are trafficked for forced street
  hawking and forced labor in small workshops
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Gabon is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to combat
  human trafficking in 2007, particularly in terms of efforts to
  convict and punish trafficking offenders; the government has not
  reported the convictions or sentences of any trafficking offenders;
  the government did not take steps to reduce demand for commercial
  sex acts (2008)

Guatemala
  current situation: Guatemala is a source, transit, and
  destination country for Guatemalans and Central Americans trafficked
  for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor;
  human trafficking is a significant and growing problem in the
  country; Guatemalan women and children are trafficked within the
  country for commercial sexual exploitation, primarily to Mexico and
  the United States; Guatemalan men, women, and children are also
  trafficked within the country, and to Mexico and the United States,
  for forced labor
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
  Guatemala is on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide
  evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons,
  particularly with respect to ensuring that trafficking offenders are
  appropriately prosecuted for their crimes; while prosecutors
  initiated trafficking prosecutions, they continued to face problems
  in court with application of Guatemala's comprehensive
  anti-trafficking law; the government made modest improvements to its
  protection efforts, but assistance remained inadequate overall in
  2007 (2008)

Guinea
  current situation: Guinea is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation; the majority of
  victims are children, and internal trafficking is more prevalent
  than transnational trafficking; within the country, girls are
  trafficked primarily for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation,
  while boys are trafficked for forced agricultural labor, and as
  forced beggars, street vendors, shoe shiners, and laborers in gold
  and diamond mines; some Guinean men are also trafficked for
  agricultural labor within Guinea; transnationally, girls are
  trafficked into Guinea for domestic servitude and likely also for
  sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Guinea is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  eliminate trafficking over 2006; Guinea demonstrated minimal law
  enforcement efforts for a second year in a row, while protection
  efforts diminished over efforts in 2006; the government did not
  report any trafficking convictions in 2007; due to a lack of
  resources, the government does not provide shelter services for
  trafficking victims; the government took no measures to reduce the
  demand for commercial sexual exploitation (2008)

Guinea-Bissau
  current situation: Guinea-Bissau is a source country
  for children trafficked primarily for forced begging and forced
  agricultural labor to other West African countries
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for the second year in a row,
  Guinea-Bissau is on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to combat
  severe forms of trafficking in persons, as evidenced by the
  continued failure to pass an anti-trafficking law and inadequate
  efforts to investigate or prosecute trafficking crimes or convict
  and punish trafficking offenders (2008)

Guyana
  current situation: Guyana is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; most
  trafficking appears to take place in remote mining camps in the
  country's interior; some women and girls are trafficked from
  northern Brazil; reporting from other nations suggests Guyanese
  women and girls are trafficked for sexual exploitation to
  neighboring countries and Guyanese men and boys are subject to labor
  exploitation in construction and agriculture; trafficking victims
  from Suriname, Brazil, and Venezuela transit Guyana en route to
  Caribbean destinations
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
  Guyana is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence
  of increasing efforts to combat trafficking, particularly in the
  area of law enforcement actions against trafficking offenders; the
  government has yet to produce an anti-trafficking conviction under
  the comprehensive Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act, which
  became law in 2005; the government operates no shelters for
  trafficking victims, but did include limited funding for
  anti-trafficking NGOs in its 2008 budget; the government did not
  make any effort to reduce demand for commercial sex acts during 2007
  (2008)

India
  current situation: India is a source, destination, and transit
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation; internal forced
  labor may constitute India's largest trafficking problem; men,
  women, and children are held in debt bondage and face forced labor
  working in brick kilns, rice mills, agriculture, and embroidery
  factories; women and girls are trafficked within the country for the
  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced marriage;
  children are subjected to forced labor as factory workers, domestic
  servants, beggars, and agriculture workers, and have been used as
  armed combatants by some terrorist and insurgent groups; India is
  also a destination for women and girls from Nepal and Bangladesh
  trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; Indian
  women are trafficked to the Middle East for commercial sexual
  exploitation; men and women from Bangladesh and Nepal are trafficked
  through India for forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation in
  the Middle East
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - India is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for a fifth consecutive year for its failure to provide evidence of
  increasing efforts to combat human trafficking in 2007; despite the
  reported extent of the trafficking crisis in India, government
  authorities made uneven efforts to prosecute traffickers and protect
  trafficking victims; government authorities continued to rescue
  victims of commercial sexual exploitation and forced child labor and
  child armed combatants, and began to show progress in law
  enforcement against these forms of trafficking; a critical challenge
  overall is the lack of punishment for traffickers, effectively
  resulting in impunity for acts of human trafficking; India has not
  ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Iran
  current situation: Iran is a source, transit, and destination
  country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
  sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude; Iranian women are
  trafficked internally for the purpose of forced prostitution and for
  forced marriages to settle debts; Iranian and Afghan children living
  in Iran are trafficked internally for the purpose of forced
  marriages, commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude
  as beggars or laborers to pay debts, provide income or support drug
  addiction of their families; press reports indicate that criminal
  organizations play a significant role in human trafficking to and
  from Iran, in connection with smuggling of migrants, drugs, and arms
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Iran did not provide evidence of law
  enforcement activities against trafficking, and credible reports
  indicate that Iranian authorities' response is not sufficient to
  penalize offenders, protect victims, and eliminate trafficking; some
  aspects of Iranian law and policy hinder efforts to combat
  trafficking including punishment of victims and legal obstacles to
  punishing offenders; Iran has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol
  (2009)

Korea, North
  current situation: North Korea is a source country for
  men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor
  and commercial sexual exploitation; the most common form of
  trafficking involves North Korean women and girls who cross the
  border into China voluntarily; additionally, North Korean women and
  girls are lured out of North Korea to escape poor social and
  economic conditions by the promise of food, jobs, and freedom, only
  to be forced into prostitution, marriage, or exploitative labor
  arrangements once in China
  tier rating: Tier 3 - North Korea does not fully comply with minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
  significant efforts to do so; the government does not acknowledge
  the existence of human rights abuses in the country or recognize
  trafficking, either within the country or transnationally; North
  Korea has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Kuwait
  current situation: Kuwait is a destination country for men
  and women who migrate legally from South and Southeast Asia for
  domestic or low-skilled labor, but are subjected to conditions of
  involuntary servitude by employers in Kuwait including conditions of
  physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, confinement to the
  home, and withholding of passports to restrict their freedom of
  movement; Kuwait is reportedly a transit point for South and East
  Asian workers recruited for low-skilled work in Iraq; some of these
  workers are deceived as to the true location and nature of this
  work, and others are subjected to conditions of involuntary
  servitude in Iraq
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Kuwaiti government has shown an inability to
  define trafficking and has demonstrated insufficient political will
  to address human trafficking adequately; much of the human
  trafficking found in Kuwait involves domestic workers in private
  residences and the government is reluctant to prosecute Kuwaiti
  citizens; the government has not enacted legislation targeting human
  trafficking nor established a permanent shelter for victims of
  trafficking (2009)

Libya
  current situation: Libya is a transit and destination country
  for men and women from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia trafficked for
  the purposes of forced labor and commercial sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Libya is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to address
  trafficking in persons in 2007 when compared to 2006, particularly
  in the area of investigating and prosecuting trafficking offenses;
  Libya did not publicly release any data on investigations or
  punishment of any trafficking offenses (2008)

Malaysia
  current situation: Malaysia is a destination and, to a
  lesser extent, a source and transit country for women and children
  trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation, and
  men, women, and children for forced labor; Malaysia is mainly a
  destination country for men, women, and children who migrate
  willingly from South and Southeast Asia to work, some of whom are
  subjected to conditions of involuntary servitude by Malaysian
  employers in the domestic, agricultural, construction, plantation,
  and industrial sectors; to a lesser extent, some Malaysian women,
  primarily of Chinese ethnicity, are trafficked abroad for commercial
  sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Malaysia does not
  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so, despite
  some progress in enforcing the 2007 comprehensive anti-trafficking
  law; it has yet to fully address labor trafficking in Malaysia;
  there are credible allegations of involvement of Malaysian
  immigration officials in trafficking and extorting Burmese refugees;
  the government did not develop mechanisms to effectively screen
  victims of trafficking in vulnerable groups and condones the
  confiscation of passports of migrant workers by employers (2009)

Mauritania
  current situation: Mauritania is a source and destination
  country for children trafficked for forced labor and sexual
  exploitation; slavery-related practices, rooted in ancestral
  master-slave relationships, continue to exist in isolated parts of
  the country; Mauritanian boys called talibe are trafficked within
  the country by religious teachers for forced begging; children are
  also trafficked by street gangs within the country that force them
  to steal, beg, and sell drugs; girls are trafficked internally for
  domestic servitude and sexual exploitation; women and children from
  neighboring states are trafficked into Mauritania for purposes of
  forced begging, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Mauritania does not fully
  comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
  and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government did
  not show evidence of overall progress in prosecuting and punishing
  trafficking offenders, protecting trafficking victims, and
  preventing new incidents of trafficking during the past year;
  progress that the previous government demonstrated in 2007 through
  enactment of strengthened anti-slavery legislation and deepened
  political will to eliminate slavery and trafficking has stalled; law
  enforcement efforts to address human trafficking including
  traditional slavery practices decreased (2009)

Moldova
  current situation: Moldova is a major source and, to a
  lesser extent, a transit country for women and girls trafficked for
  the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; Moldovan women are
  trafficked to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe;
  girls and young women are trafficked within the country from rural
  areas to Chisinau; children are also trafficked to neighboring
  countries for forced labor and begging; labor trafficking of men to
  work in the construction, agriculture, and service sectors of Russia
  is increasingly a problem; according to an ILO report, Moldova's
  national Bureau of Statistics estimated that there were likely over
  25,000 Moldovan victims of trafficking for forced labor in 2008
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - The Government of Moldova does not
  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so;
  despite initial efforts to combat trafficking-related complicity
  since the government's reassessment on the Tier 2 Watch List in
  September 2008, and increased victim assistance, the government did
  not demonstrate sufficiently meaningful efforts to curb
  trafficking-related corruption, which is a government-acknowledged
  problem in Moldova; the government improved victim protection
  efforts, deployed more law-enforcement officers in the effort and
  contributed direct financial assistance toward victim protection and
  assistance for the first time (2010)

Niger
  current situation: Niger is a source, transit, and destination
  country for children and women trafficked for forced labor and
  sexual exploitation; caste-based slavery practices, rooted in
  ancestral master-slave relationships, continue in isolated areas of
  the country - an estimated 8,800 to 43,000 Nigeriens live under
  conditions of traditional slavery; children are trafficked within
  Niger for forced begging, forced labor in gold mines, domestic
  servitude, sexual exploitation, and possibly for forced labor in
  agriculture and stone quarries; women and children from neighboring
  states are trafficked to and through Niger for domestic servitude,
  sexual exploitation, forced labor in mines and on farms, and as
  mechanics and welders
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Niger does not
  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking and is not making any significant efforts to do so; the
  government demonstrated marginal efforts to combat human
  trafficking, including traditional slavery, during the last year
  (2009)

Papua New Guinea
  current situation: Papua New Guinea is a country of
  destination for women and children from Malaysia, the Philippines,
  Thailand, and China trafficked for the purpose of commercial sexual
  exploitation; internal trafficking of women and children for the
  purposes of sexual exploitation and involuntary domestic servitude
  occurs as well
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Papua New Guinea does not fully comply with
  the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
  making significant efforts to do so; the current legal framework
  does not contain elements of crimes that characterize trafficking;
  the government lacks victim protection services or a systematic
  procedure to identify victims of trafficking; the government did not
  prosecute anyone in 2007 for trafficking; Papua New Guinea has not
  ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Qatar
  current situation: Qatar is a destination country for men and
  women from South and Southeast Asia who migrate willingly, but are
  subsequently trafficked into involuntary servitude as domestic
  workers and laborers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial sexual
  exploitation; the most common offense was forcing workers to accept
  worse contract terms than those under which they were recruited;
  other conditions include bonded labor, withholding of pay,
  restrictions on movement, arbitrary detention, and physical, mental,
  and sexual abuse
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the Government of Qatar does not
  fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so; in
  February 2009, Qatar enacted a new migrant worker sponsorship law
  that criminalizes some practices commonly used by trafficking
  offenders, and it announced plans to use that law effectively to
  prevent human trafficking; punishment for offenses related to
  trafficking in persons remains lower than that for crimes such as
  rape and kidnapping, and the Qatari government has yet to take
  significant action to investigate, prosecute, and punish trafficking
  offenses; the government continues to lack formal victim
  identification procedures and, as a result, victims of trafficking
  are likely punished for acts committed as a direct result of being
  trafficked (2009)

Russia
  current situation: Russia is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for
  various purposes; it remains a significant source of women
  trafficked to over 50 countries for commercial sexual exploitation;
  Russia is also a transit and destination country for men and women
  trafficked from Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Korea to
  Central and Western Europe and the Middle East for purposes of
  forced labor and sexual exploitation; internal trafficking remains a
  problem in Russia with women trafficked from rural areas to urban
  centers for commercial sexual exploitation, and men trafficked
  internally and from Central Asia for forced labor in the
  construction and agricultural industries; debt bondage is common
  among trafficking victims, and child sex tourism remains a concern
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Russia is on the Tier 2 Watch List
  for a fifth consecutive year for its failure to show evidence of
  increasing efforts to combat trafficking over the previous year,
  particularly in providing assistance to victims of trafficking;
  comprehensive trafficking victim assistance legislation, which would
  address key deficiencies, has been pending before the Duma since
  2003 and was neither passed nor enacted in 2007 (2008)

Saudi Arabia
  current situation: Saudi Arabia is a destination
  country for workers from South and Southeast Asia who are subjected
  to conditions that constitute involuntary servitude including being
  subjected to physical and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages,
  confinement, and withholding of passports as a restriction on their
  movement; domestic workers are particularly vulnerable because some
  are confined to the house in which they work unable to seek help;
  Saudi Arabia is also a destination country for Nigerian, Yemeni,
  Pakistani, Afghan, Somali, Malian, and Sudanese children trafficked
  for forced begging and involuntary servitude as street vendors; some
  Nigerian women were reportedly trafficked into Saudi Arabia for
  commercial sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Saudi Arabia does not fully comply with the
  minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not
  making significant efforts to do so; the government continues to
  lack adequate anti-trafficking laws and, despite evidence of
  widespread trafficking abuses, did not report any criminal
  prosecutions, convictions, or prison sentences for trafficking
  crimes committed against foreign domestic workers (2008)

Sri Lanka
  current situation: Sri Lanka is a source and destination
  country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary
  servitude and commercial sexual exploitation; Sri Lankan men and
  women migrate willingly to the Persian Gulf, Middle East, and East
  Asia to work as construction workers, domestic servants, or garment
  factory workers, where some find themselves in situations of
  involuntary servitude when faced with restrictions on movement,
  withholding of passports, threats, physical or sexual abuse, and
  debt bondage; children are trafficked internally for commercial
  sexual exploitation and, less frequently, for forced labor
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a fourth consecutive year, Sri
  Lanka is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence of
  increasing efforts to combat severe forms of human trafficking,
  particularly in the area of law enforcement; the government failed
  to arrest, prosecute, or convict any person for trafficking offenses
  and continued to punish some victims of trafficking for crimes
  committed as a result of being trafficked; Sri Lanka has not
  ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Sudan
  current situation: Sudan is a source country for men, women,
  and children trafficked internally for the purposes of forced labor
  and sexual exploitation; Sudan is also a transit and destination
  country for Ethiopian women trafficked abroad for domestic
  servitude; Sudanese women and girls are trafficked within the
  country as well as possibly to Middle Eastern countries for domestic
  servitude; the terrorist rebel organization, Lord's Resistance Army,
  continues to harbor small numbers of Sudanese and Ugandan children
  in the southern part of the country for use as cooks, porters, and
  combatants; some of these children are also trafficked across
  borders into Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo; militia
  groups in Darfur, some of which are linked to the government, abduct
  women for short periods of forced labor and to perpetrate sexual
  violence; during the two decades-long north-south civil war,
  thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently
  enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes; while
  there have been no known new abductions of Dinka by members of
  Baggara tribes in the last few years, inter-tribal abductions
  continue in southern Sudan
  tier rating: Tier 3 - Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum
  standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
  significant efforts to do so; combating human trafficking through
  law enforcement or prevention measures was not a priority for the
  government in 2007 (2008)

Swaziland
  current situation: Swaziland is a source, destination, and
  transit country for women and children trafficked internally and
  transnationally for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation,
  domestic servitude, and forced labor in agriculture; Swazi girls,
  particularly orphans, are trafficked internally for commercial
  sexual exploitation and domestic servitude, as well as to South
  Africa and Mozambique; Swazi boys are trafficked for forced labor in
  commercial agriculture and market vending; some Swazi women are
  forced into prostitution in South Africa and Mozambique after
  voluntarily migrating to these countries in search of work
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the government of Swaziland does
  not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
  trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the
  government believes that trafficking probably does occur, but does
  not know the extent of the problem; the government does not judge
  trafficking to be an "important" problem and chooses to direct its
  limited resources towards other issues, a judgment which
  significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate
  human trafficking, or to plan anti-trafficking activities or
  initiatives for the future (2010)

Syria
  current situation: Syria is a destination and transit country
  for women and children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation
  and forced labor; a significant number of women and children in the
  large and expanding Iraqi refugee community in Syria are reportedly
  forced into commercial sexual exploitation by Iraqi gangs or, in
  some cases, their families; women from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the
  Philippines, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone are recruited for work in
  Syria as domestic servants, but some face conditions of involuntary
  servitude, including long hours, non-payment of wages, withholding
  of passports, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical or
  sexual abuse
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Syria again failed to report any
  law enforcement efforts to punish trafficking offenses in 2007; in
  addition, the government did not offer protection services to
  victims of trafficking and may have arrested, prosecuted, or
  deported some victims for prostitution or immigration violations;
  Syria has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)

Tajikistan
  current situation: Tajikistan is a source country for
  women trafficked through Kyrgyzstan and Russia to the UAE, Turkey,
  and Russia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; men
  are trafficked to Russia and Kazakhstan for the purpose of forced
  labor, primarily in the construction and agricultural industries;
  boys and girls are trafficked internally for various purposes,
  including forced labor and forced begging
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Tajikistan is on the Tier 2 Watch
  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat human trafficking, especially efforts to investigate,
  prosecute, convict, and sentence traffickers; despite evidence of
  low- and mid-level officials' complicity in trafficking, the
  government did not punish any public officials for trafficking
  complicity during 2007; lack of capacity and poor coordination
  between government institutions remained key obstacles to effective
  anti-trafficking efforts (2008)

Uzbekistan
  current situation: Uzbekistan is a source country for
  women and girls trafficked to Kazakhstan, Russia, Middle East, and
  Asia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; men are
  trafficked to Kazakhstan and Russia for purposes of forced labor in
  the construction, cotton, and tobacco industries; men and women are
  also trafficked internally for the purposes of domestic servitude,
  forced labor in the agricultural and construction industries, and
  for commercial sexual exploitation
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Uzbekistan is on the Tier 2 Watch
  List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
  combat severe forms of trafficking in 2007; the government did not
  amend its criminal code to increase penalties for convicted
  traffickers; in March 2008, Uzbekistan adopted ILO Conventions on
  minimum age of employment and on the elimination of the worst forms
  of child labor and is working with the ILO on implementation; the
  government also demonstrated its increasing commitment to combat
  trafficking in March 2008 by adopting a comprehensive
  anti-trafficking law; Uzbekistan has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP
  Protocol (2008)

Venezuela
  current situation: Venezuela is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor;
  Venezuelan women and girls are trafficked within the country for
  sexual exploitation, lured from the nation's interior to urban and
  tourist areas; child prostitution in urban areas and child sex
  tourism in resort destinations appear to be growing; Venezuelan
  women and girls are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation to
  Western Europe, Mexico, and Caribbean destinations
  tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Venezuela is placed on the Tier 2
  Watch List, up from Tier 3, as it showed greater resolve to address
  trafficking through law enforcement measures and prevention efforts
  in 2007, although stringent punishment of offenders and victim
  assistance remain lacking (2008)

World
  current situation: approximately 800,000 people, mostly women
  and children, are trafficked annually across national borders, not
  including millions trafficked within their own countries; at least
  80% of the victims are female and up to 50% are minors; 75% of all
  victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation; almost
  two-thirds of the global victims are trafficked intra-regionally
  within East Asia and the Pacific (260,000 to 280,000 people) and
  Europe and Eurasia (170,000 to 210,000 people)

Zimbabwe
  current situation: Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and
  destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
  purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation; large scale
  migration of Zimbabweans to surrounding countries - as they flee a
  progressively more desperate situation at home - has increased;
  rural Zimbabwean men, women, and children are trafficked internally
  to farms for agricultural labor and domestic servitude and to cities
  for domestic labor and commercial sexual exploitation; NGOs believe
  internal trafficking increased during the year, largely due to the
  closure of schools, worsening political violence, and a faltering
  economy; young men and boys are trafficked to South Africa for farm
  work, often laboring for months in South Africa without pay before
  "employers" have them arrested and deported as illegal immigrants;
  young women and girls are lured abroad with false employment offers
  that result in involuntary domestic servitude or commercial sexual
  exploitation; men, women, and children from neighboring states are
  trafficked through Zimbabwe en route to South Africa
  tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Zimbabwe does not fully
  comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
  and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government made
  minimal progress in combating trafficking in 2008, and members of
  its military and the former ruling party's youth militias
  perpetrated acts of trafficking on local populations;
  anti-trafficking efforts were further weakened as it failed to
  address Zimbabwe's economic and social problems during the reporting
  period, thus increasing the population's vulnerability to
  trafficking within and outside of the country (2009)
