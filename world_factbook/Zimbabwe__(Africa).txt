Zimbabwe  (Africa)

Introduction ::Zimbabwe




Background:


The UK annexed Southern Rhodesia from the [British] South Africa
Company in 1923. A 1961 constitution was formulated that favored
whites in power. In 1965 the government unilaterally declared its
independence, but the UK did not recognize the act and demanded more
complete voting rights for the black African majority in the country
(then called Rhodesia). UN sanctions and a guerrilla uprising
finally led to free elections in 1979 and independence (as Zimbabwe)
in 1980. Robert MUGABE, the nation's first prime minister, has been
the country's only ruler (as president since 1987) and has dominated
the country's political system since independence. His chaotic land
redistribution campaign, which began in 2000, caused an exodus of
white farmers, crippled the economy, and ushered in widespread
shortages of basic commodities. Ignoring international condemnation,
MUGABE rigged the 2002 presidential election to ensure his
reelection. The ruling ZANU-PF party used fraud and intimidation to
win a two-thirds majority in the March 2005 parliamentary election,
allowing it to amend the constitution at will and recreate the
Senate, which had been abolished in the late 1980s. In April 2005,
Harare embarked on Operation Restore Order, ostensibly an urban
rationalization program, which resulted in the destruction of the
homes or businesses of 700,000 mostly poor supporters of the
opposition. President MUGABE in June 2007 instituted price controls
on all basic commodities causing panic buying and leaving store
shelves empty for months. General elections held in March 2008
contained irregularities but still amounted to a censure of the
ZANU-PF-led government with the opposition winning a majority of
seats in parliament. MDC opposition leader Morgan TSVANGIRAI won the
most votes in the presidential polls, but not enough to win
outright. In the lead up to a run-off election in late June 2008,
considerable violence enacted against opposition party members led
to the withdrawal of TSVANGIRAI from the ballot. Extensive evidence
of vote tampering and ballot-box stuffing resulted in international
condemnation of the process. Difficult negotiations over a
power-sharing government, in which MUGABE remained president and
TSVANGIRAI became prime minister, were finally settled in February
2009, although the leaders have yet failed to agree upon many key
outstanding governmental issues.

Economy ::Zimbabwe




Economy - overview:


The government of Zimbabwe faces a wide variety of difficult
economic problems. Its 1998-2002 involvement in the war in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo drained hundreds of millions of
dollars from the economy. The government's land reform program,
characterized by chaos and violence, has badly damaged the
commercial farming sector, the traditional source of exports and
foreign exchange and the provider of 400,000 jobs, turning Zimbabwe
into a net importer of food products. The EU and the US provide food
aid on humanitarian grounds. Until early 2009, the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe routinely printed money to fund the budget deficit, causing
hyperinflation. The power-sharing government formed in February 2009
has led to some economic improvements, including the cessation of
hyperinflation by eliminating the use of the Zimbabwe dollar and
removing price controls. The economy is registering its first growth
in a decade, but will be reliant on further political improvement
for greater growth.

Transnational Issues ::Zimbabwe




Disputes - international:


Botswana built electric fences and South Africa has placed military
along the border to stem the flow of thousands of Zimbabweans
fleeing to find work and escape political persecution; Namibia has
supported, and in 2004 Zimbabwe dropped objections to, plans between
Botswana and Zambia to build a bridge over the Zambezi River,
thereby de facto recognizing a short, but not clearly delimited,
Botswana-Zambia boundary in the river



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 2,500 (Democratic Republic of Congo)

IDPs: 569,685 (MUGABE-led political violence, human rights
violations, land reform, and economic collapse) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Zimbabwe is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
forced labor and sexual exploitation; large scale migration of
Zimbabweans to surrounding countries - as they flee a progressively
more desperate situation at home - has increased; rural Zimbabwean
men, women, and children are trafficked internally to farms for
agricultural labor and domestic servitude and to cities for domestic
labor and commercial sexual exploitation; NGOs believe internal
trafficking increased during the year, largely due to the closure of
schools, worsening political violence, and a faltering economy;
young men and boys are trafficked to South Africa for farm work,
often laboring for months in South Africa without pay before
"employers" have them arrested and deported as illegal immigrants;
young women and girls are lured abroad with false employment offers
that result in involuntary domestic servitude or commercial sexual
exploitation; men, women, and children from neighboring states are
trafficked through Zimbabwe en route to South Africa

tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Zimbabwe does not fully
comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government made
minimal progress in combating trafficking in 2008, and members of
its military and the former ruling party's youth militias
perpetrated acts of trafficking on local populations;
anti-trafficking efforts were further weakened as it failed to
address Zimbabwe's economic and social problems during the reporting
period, thus increasing the population's vulnerability to
trafficking within and outside of the country (2009)



Illicit drugs:


transit point for cannabis and South Asian heroin, mandrax, and
methamphetamines en route to South Africa
