Jamaica  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Jamaica




Background:


The island - discovered by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1494 - was
settled by the Spanish early in the 16th century. The native Taino
Indians, who had inhabited Jamaica for centuries, were gradually
exterminated and replaced by African slaves. England seized the
island in 1655 and established a plantation economy based on sugar,
cocoa, and coffee. The abolition of slavery in 1834 freed a quarter
million slaves, many of whom became small farmers. Jamaica gradually
obtained increasing independence from Britain. In 1958 it joined
other British Caribbean colonies in forming the Federation of the
West Indies. Jamaica gained full independence when it withdrew from
the Federation in 1962. Deteriorating economic conditions during the
1970s led to recurrent violence as rival gangs affiliated with the
major political parties evolved into powerful organized crime
networks involved in international drug smuggling and money
laundering. Violent crime, drug trafficking, and poverty pose
significant challenges to the government today. Nonetheless, many
rural and resort areas remain relatively safe and contribute
substantially to the economy.

Economy ::Jamaica




Economy - overview:


The Jamaican economy is heavily dependent on services, which now
account for more than 60% of GDP. The country continues to derive
most of its foreign exchange from tourism, remittances, and
bauxite/alumina. Remittances account for nearly 15% of GDP and
exports of bauxite and alumina make up about 10%. Tourism revenues
account for roughly 10% of GDP, and both arrivals and revenues grew
in 2010, up 4% and 6% respectively. The Economic growth faces many
challenges: high crime and corruption, large-scale unemployment and
underemployment, and a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%.
Jamaica's onerous debt burden - the fourth highest per capita - is
the result of government bailouts to ailing sectors of the economy,
most notably to the financial sector in the mid-to-late 1990s. The
Government of Jamaica signed a $1.27 billion, 27-month Standby
Agreement with the International Monetary Fund for balance of
payment support in February 2010. Other multilaterals have also
provided millions of dollars in loans and grants. The government's
difficult fiscal position hinders spending on infrastructure and
social programs, particularly as job losses rise in a shrinking
economy. The GOLDING administration faces the difficult prospect of
having to achieve fiscal discipline in order to maintain debt
payments, while simultaneously attacking a serious and growing crime
problem that is hampering economic growth. High unemployment
exacerbates the crime problem, including gang violence that is
fueled by the drug trade.
