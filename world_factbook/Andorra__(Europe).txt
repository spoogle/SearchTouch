Andorra  (Europe)

Introduction ::Andorra




Background:


For 715 years, from 1278 to 1993, Andorrans lived under a unique
co-principality, ruled by French and Spanish leaders (from 1607
onward, the French chief of state and the Spanish bishop of Seu
d'Urgell). In 1993, this feudal system was modified with the titular
heads of state retained, but the government transformed into a
parliamentary democracy. For decades Andorra enjoyed its status as a
small refuge of fiscal and banking freedom and benefitted from
Spanish and French tourists attracted to the country's duty-free
shopping. The situation has changed in recent years as Andorra
started to tax foreign investment and other sectors. Tourism
accounts for over 80% of Andorra's gross domestic product.

Economy ::Andorra




Economy - overview:


Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy,
accounts for more than 80% of GDP. An estimated 11 million tourists
visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status for some
products and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative
advantage eroded when the borders of neighboring France and Spain
opened, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs.
The banking sector, with its partial "tax haven" status, also
contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
limited - only 2% of the land is arable - and most food has to be
imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing output consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and
furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is
treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs)
and as a non-EU member for agricultural products.
