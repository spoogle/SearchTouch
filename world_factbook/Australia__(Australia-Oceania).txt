Australia  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Australia




Background:


Aboriginal settlers arrived on the continent from Southeast Asia
about 40,000 years before the first Europeans began exploration in
the 17th century. No formal territorial claims were made until 1770,
when Capt. James COOK took possession in the name of Great Britain.
Six colonies were created in the late 18th and 19th centuries; they
federated and became the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901. The new
country took advantage of its natural resources to rapidly develop
agricultural and manufacturing industries and to make a major
contribution to the British effort in World Wars I and II. In recent
decades, Australia has transformed itself into an internationally
competitive, advanced market economy. It boasted one of the OECD's
fastest growing economies during the 1990s, a performance due in
large part to economic reforms adopted in the 1980s. Long-term
concerns include climate-change issues such as the depletion of the
ozone layer and more frequent droughts, and management and
conservation of coastal areas, especially the Great Barrier Reef.

Economy ::Australia




Economy - overview:


Australia's abundant and diverse natural resources attract high
levels of foreign investment and include extensive reserves of coal,
iron ore, copper, gold, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy
sources. A series of major investments, such as the US$40 billion
Gorgon Liquid Natural Gas project, will significantly expand the
resources sector. Australia also has a large services sector and is
a significant exporter of natural resources, energy, and food. Key
tenets of Australia's trade policy include support for open trade
and the successful culmination of the Doha Round of multilateral
trade negotiations, particularly for agriculture and services. The
Australian economy grew for 17 consecutive years before the global
financial crisis. Subsequently, the Rudd government introduced a
fiscal stimulus package worth over US$50 billion to offset the
effect of the slowing world economy, while the Reserve Bank of
Australia cut interest rates to historic lows. These policies - and
continued demand for commodities, especially from China - helped the
Australian economy rebound after just one quarter of negative
growth. The economy grew by 1.2% during 2009 - the best performance
in the OECD. Unemployment, originally expected to reach 8-10%,
peaked at 5.7% in late 2009 and fell to 5.1% in 2010. As a result of
an improved economy, the budget deficit is expected to peak below
4.2% of GDP and the government could return to budget surpluses as
early as 2015. Australia was one of the first advanced economies to
raise interest rates, with seven rate hikes between October 2009 and
November 2010. The GILLARD government is focused on raising
Australia's economic productivity to ensure the sustainability of
growth, and continues to manage the symbiotic, but sometimes tense,
economic relationship with China. Australia is engaged in the
Trans-Pacific Partnership talks and ongoing free trade agreement
negotiations with China, Japan, and Korea.
