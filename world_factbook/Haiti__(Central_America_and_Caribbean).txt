Haiti  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Haiti




Background:


The native Taino Amerindians - who inhabited the island of
Hispaniola when it was discovered by COLUMBUS in 1492 - were
virtually annihilated by Spanish settlers within 25 years. In the
early 17th century, the French established a presence on Hispaniola.
In 1697, Spain ceded to the French the western third of the island,
which later became Haiti. The French colony, based on forestry and
sugar-related industries, became one of the wealthiest in the
Caribbean but only through the heavy importation of African slaves
and considerable environmental degradation. In the late 18th
century, Haiti's nearly half million slaves revolted under Toussaint
L'OUVERTURE. After a prolonged struggle, Haiti became the first
black republic to declare independence in 1804. The poorest country
in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political
violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to
the forced resignation and exile of President Jean-Bertrand ARISTIDE
in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new
elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization
Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays
prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a
democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006. A
massive magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti in January 2010 with
an epicenter about 15 km southwest of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
An estimated 2 million people live within the zone of heavy to
moderate structural damage. The earthquake is assessed as the worst
in this region over the last 200 years and massive international
assistance will be required to help the country recover.

Economy ::Haiti




Economy - overview:


Haiti's economy suffered a severe setback when a 7.1 magnitude
earthquake damaged its capital city, Port-au-Prince, in January
2010. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere with 80%
of the population living under the poverty line and 54% in abject
poverty, the damage to Port-au-Prince caused the country's GDP to
contract an estimated 8% in 2010. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend
on the agricultural sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming,
and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters,
exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. US economic
engagement under the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through
Partnership Encouragement (HOPE) Act, passed in December 2006, has
boosted apparel exports and investment by providing tariff-free
access to the US. Congress voted in 2010 to extend the legislation
until 2020 under the Haitian Economic Lift Act (HELP); the apparel
sector accounts for three-quarters of Haitian exports and nearly
one-tenth of GDP. Remittances are the primary source of foreign
exchange, equaling nearly a quarter of GDP and more than twice the
earnings from exports. Haiti suffers from a lack of investment
because of insecurity and limited infrastructure, and a severe trade
deficit. In 2005, Haiti paid its arrears to the World Bank, paving
the way for reengagement with the Bank. Haiti received debt
forgiveness for over $1 billion of its debt through the
Highly-Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative in 2009. The
remainder of its outstanding external debt was cancelled by donor
countries in early 2010 but has since climbed back to about $500
million. The government relies on formal international economic
assistance for fiscal sustainability.
