Mauritius  (Africa)

Introduction ::Mauritius




Background:


Although known to Arab and Malay sailors as early as the 10th
century, Mauritius was first explored by the Portuguese in the 16th
century and subsequently settled by the Dutch - who named it in
honor of Prince Maurits van NASSAU - in the 17th century. The French
assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important
naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a
plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in
1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically
important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an
important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy
operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence.
Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy
with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the
country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned
one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather,
declining sugar prices, and declining textile and apparel
production, have slowed economic growth, leading to some protests
over standards of living in the Creole community.

Economy ::Mauritius




Economy - overview:


Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a
low-income, agriculturally based economy to a middle-income
diversified economy with growing industrial, financial, and tourist
sectors. For most of the period, annual growth has been in the order
of 5% to 6%. This remarkable achievement has been reflected in more
equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered
infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy
rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial
services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and
communications technology, and hospitality and property development.
Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and
accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development
strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of
development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than
32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South
Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has
reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector,
has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and
Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and
prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects from
the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew 3.6% in 2010 and
the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach
around the globe.
