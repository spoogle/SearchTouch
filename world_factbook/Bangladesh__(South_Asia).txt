Bangladesh  (South Asia)

Introduction ::Bangladesh




Background:


Europeans began to set up trading posts in the area of Bangladesh in
the 16th century; eventually the British came to dominate the region
and it became part of British India. In 1947, West Pakistan and East
Bengal (both primarily Muslim) separated from India (largely Hindu)
and jointly became the new country of Pakistan. East Bengal became
East Pakistan in 1955, but the awkward arrangement of a two-part
country with its territorial units separated by 1,600 km left the
Bengalis marginalized and dissatisfied. East Pakistan seceded from
its union with West Pakistan in 1971 and was renamed Bangladesh. A
military-backed, emergency caretaker regime suspended parliamentary
elections planned for January 2007 in an effort to reform the
political system and root out corruption. In contrast to the strikes
and violent street rallies that had marked Bangladeshi politics in
previous years, the parliamentary elections finally held in late
December 2008 were mostly peaceful and Sheikh HASINA Wajed was
elected prime minister. About a third of this extremely poor country
floods annually during the monsoon rainy season, hampering economic
development.

Economy ::Bangladesh




Economy - overview:


The economy has grown 5-6% per year since 1996 despite political
instability, poor infrastructure, corruption, insufficient power
supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Bangladesh
remains a poor, overpopulated, and inefficiently-governed nation.
Although more than half of GDP is generated through the service
sector, 45% of Bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector,
with rice as the single-most-important product. Bangladesh's growth
was resilient during the 2008-09 global financial crisis and
recession. Garment exports, totaling $12.3 billion in FY09 and
remittances from overseas Bangladeshis totaling $9.7 billion in FY09
accounted for almost 25% of GDP.

Transnational Issues ::Bangladesh




Disputes - international:


discussions with India remain stalled to delimit a small section of
river boundary, exchange territory for 51 small Bangladeshi exclaves
in India and 111 small Indian exclaves in Bangladesh, allocate
divided villages, and stop illegal cross-border trade, migration,
violence, and transit of terrorists through the porous border;
Bangladesh protests India's fencing and walling off high-traffic
sections of the porous boundary; a joint Bangladesh-India boundary
commission resurveyed and reconstructed 92 missing pillars in 2007;
after 21 years, Bangladesh in January 2008 resumed talks with Burma
on delimiting a maritime boundary



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 26,268 (Burma)

IDPs: 65,000 (land conflicts, religious persecution) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Bangladesh is a source and transit country for
men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor
and commercial sexual exploitation; a significant share of
Bangladesh's trafficking victims are men recruited for work overseas
with fraudulent employment offers who are subsequently exploited
under conditions of forced labor or debt bondage; children are
trafficked within Bangladesh for commercial sexual exploitation,
bonded labor, and forced labor; women and children from Bangladesh
are also trafficked to India and Pakistan for sexual exploitation

tier rating: Bangladesh is placed on Tier 2 Watch List because it
does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination
of trafficking; however, it is making significant efforts to do so,
including some progress in addressing sex trafficking; the
government did not demonstrate sufficient progress in criminally
prosecuting and convicting labor trafficking offenders, particularly
those responsible for the recruitment of Bangladeshi workers for the
purpose of labor trafficking (2009)



Illicit drugs:


transit country for illegal drugs produced in neighboring countries
