Syria  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Syria




Background:


Following World War I, France acquired a mandate over the northern
portion of the former Ottoman Empire province of Syria. The French
administered the area as Syria until granting it independence in
1946. The new country lacked political stability, however, and
experienced a series of military coups during its first decades.
Syria united with Egypt in February 1958 to form the United Arab
Republic. In September 1961, the two entities separated, and the
Syrian Arab Republic was reestablished. In November 1970, Hafiz
al-ASAD, a member of the Socialist Ba'th Party and the minority
Alawite sect, seized power in a bloodless coup and brought political
stability to the country. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Syria lost
the Golan Heights to Israel. During the 1990s, Syria and Israel held
occasional peace talks over its return. Following the death of
President al-ASAD, his son, Bashar al-ASAD, was approved as
president by popular referendum in July 2000. Syrian troops -
stationed in Lebanon since 1976 in an ostensible peacekeeping role -
were withdrawn in April 2005. During the July-August 2006 conflict
between Israel and Hizballah, Syria placed its military forces on
alert but did not intervene directly on behalf of its ally
Hizballah. In May 2007 Bashar al-ASAD was elected to his second term
as president.

Economy ::Syria




Economy - overview:


Syrian economic growth slowed to 1.8% in 2009 as the global economic
crisis affected oil prices and the economies of Syria's key export
partners and sources of investment. Damascus has implemented modest
economic reforms in the past few years, including cutting lending
interest rates, opening private banks, consolidating all of the
multiple exchange rates, raising prices on some subsidized items,
most notably gasoline and cement, and establishing the Damascus
Stock Exchange - which began operations in 2009. In addition,
President ASAD signed legislative decrees to encourage corporate
ownership reform, and to allow the Central Bank to issue Treasury
bills and bonds for government debt. Nevertheless, the economy
remains highly controlled by the government. Long-run economic
constraints include declining oil production, high unemployment,
rising budget deficits, and increasing pressure on water supplies
caused by heavy use in agriculture, rapid population growth,
industrial expansion, and water pollution.

Transnational Issues ::Syria




Disputes - international:


Golan Heights is Israeli-occupied with the almost 1,000-strong UN
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) patrolling a buffer zone since
1964; lacking a treaty or other documentation describing the
boundary, portions of the Lebanon-Syria boundary are unclear with
several sections in dispute; since 2000, Lebanon has claimed Shab'a
Farms in the Golan Heights; 2004 Agreement and pending demarcation
settles border dispute with Jordan; approximately two million Iraqis
have fled the conflict in Iraq with the majority taking refuge in
Syria and Jordan



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 1-1.4 million (Iraq); 522,100
(Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA))

IDPs: 305,000 (most displaced from Golan Heights during 1967
Arab-Israeli War) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Syria is a destination and transit country for
women and children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and
forced labor; a significant number of women and children in the
large and expanding Iraqi refugee community in Syria are reportedly
forced into commercial sexual exploitation by Iraqi gangs or, in
some cases, their families; women from Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the
Philippines, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone are recruited for work in
Syria as domestic servants, but some face conditions of involuntary
servitude, including long hours, non-payment of wages, withholding
of passports, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical or
sexual abuse

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Syria again failed to report any
law enforcement efforts to punish trafficking offenses in 2007; in
addition, the government did not offer protection services to
victims of trafficking and may have arrested, prosecuted, or
deported some victims for prostitution or immigration violations;
Syria has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)



Illicit drugs:


a transit point for opiates, hashish, and cocaine bound for regional
and Western markets; weak anti-money-laundering controls and bank
privatization may leave it vulnerable to money laundering
