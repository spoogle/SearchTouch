Montserrat  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Montserrat




Background:


English and Irish colonists from St. Kitts first settled on
Montserrat in 1632; the first African slaves arrived three decades
later. The British and French fought for possession of the island
for most of the 18th century, but it finally was confirmed as a
British possession in 1783. The island's sugar plantation economy
was converted to small farm landholdings in the mid 19th century.
Much of this island was devastated and two-thirds of the population
fled abroad because of the eruption of the Soufriere Hills Volcano
that began on 18 July 1995. Montserrat has endured volcanic activity
since, with the last eruption occurring in July 2003.

Economy ::Montserrat




Economy - overview:


Severe volcanic activity, which began in July 1995, has put a damper
on this small, open economy. A catastrophic eruption in June 1997
closed the airports and seaports, causing further economic and
social dislocation. Two-thirds of the 12,000 inhabitants fled the
island. Some began to return in 1998 but lack of housing limited the
number. The agriculture sector continued to be affected by the lack
of suitable land for farming and the destruction of crops. Prospects
for the economy depend largely on developments in relation to the
volcanic activity and on public sector construction activity. The UK
has launched a three-year $122.8 million aid program to help
reconstruct the economy. Half of the island is expected to remain
uninhabitable for another decade.
