Denmark  (Europe)

Introduction ::Denmark




Background:


Once the seat of Viking raiders and later a major north European
power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is
participating in the general political and economic integration of
Europe. It joined NATO in 1949 and the EEC (now the EU) in 1973.
However, the country has opted out of certain elements of the
European Union's Maastricht Treaty, including the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU), European defense cooperation, and issues
concerning certain justice and home affairs.

Flag description:


red with a white cross that extends to the edges of the flag; the
vertical part of the cross is shifted to the hoist side; the banner
is referred to as the Dannebrog (Danish flag) and is one of the
oldest national flags in the world; traditions as to the origin of
the flag design vary, but the best known is a legend that the banner
fell from the sky during an early-13th century battle; caught up by
the Danish king before it ever touched the earth, this heavenly
talisman inspired the royal army to victory; in actuality, the flag
may derive from a crusade banner or ensign

note: the shifted design element was subsequently adopted by the
other Nordic countries of Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden



National anthem:


name: "Der er et yndigt land" (There is a Lovely Land); "Kong
Christian" (King Christian)

lyrics/music: Adam Gottlob OEHLENSCHLAGER/Hans Ernst KROYER;
Johannes EWALD/unknown

note: Denmark has two national anthems with equal status; "Der er et
yndigt land," adopted 1844, is a national anthem, while "Kong
Christian," adopted 1780, serves as both a national and royal
anthem; "Kong Christian" is also known as "Kong Christian stod ved
hojen mast" (King Christian Stood by the Lofty Mast) and
"Kongesangen" (The King's Anthem); within Denmark, the royal anthem
is played only when royalty is present and is usually followed by
the national anthem; when royalty is not present, only the national
anthem is performed; outside Denmark, the royal anthem is played,
unless the national anthem is requested







Economy ::Denmark




Economy - overview:


This thoroughly modern market economy features a high-tech
agricultural sector, state-of-the-art industry with world-leading
firms in pharmaceuticals, maritime shipping and renewable energy,
and a high dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is also
characterized by extensive government welfare measures, an equitable
distribution of income, and comfortable living standards. Denmark is
a net exporter of food and energy and enjoys a comfortable balance
of payments surplus. After a long consumption-driven upswing,
Denmark's economy began slowing in 2007 with the end of a housing
boom. Housing prices dropped markedly in 2008-09. The global
financial crisis has exacerbated this cyclical slowdown through
increased borrowing costs and lower export demand, consumer
confidence, and investment. The global financial crises cut Danish
GDP by 0.9% in 2008 and 4.7% in 2009. Historically low levels of
unemployment rose sharply with the recession but remain below 5%,
about half the level of the EU. Denmark made a modest recovery in
2010 in part because of increased government spending. An impending
decline in the ratio of workers to retirees will be a major
long-term issue. Denmark maintained a healthy budget surplus for
many years up to 2008, but the budget balance swung into deficit
during 2009-10. Nonetheless, Denmark's fiscal position remains among
the strongest in the EU. Despite previously meeting the criteria to
join the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), so far Denmark
has decided not to join, although the Danish krone remains pegged to
the euro.
