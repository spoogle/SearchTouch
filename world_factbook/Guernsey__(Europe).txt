Guernsey  (Europe)

Introduction ::Guernsey




Background:


Guernsey and the other Channel Islands represent the last remnants
of the medieval Dukedom of Normandy, which held sway in both France
and England. The islands were the only British soil occupied by
German troops in World War II. Guernsey is a British crown
dependency but is not part of the UK or of the European Union.
However, the UK Government is constitutionally responsible for its
defense and international representation.

Economy ::Guernsey




Economy - overview:


Financial services - banking, fund management, insurance - account
for about 23% of employment and about 55% of total income in this
tiny, prosperous Channel Island economy. Tourism, manufacturing, and
horticulture, mainly tomatoes and cut flowers, have been declining.
Financial services, construction, retail, and the public sector have
been growing. Light tax and death duties make Guernsey a popular tax
haven. The evolving economic integration of the EU nations is
changing the environment under which Guernsey operates.
