Introduction ::Slovakia




Background:


The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the close of World
War I allowed the Slovaks to join the closely related Czechs to form
Czechoslovakia. Following the chaos of World War II, Czechoslovakia
became a Communist nation within Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe.
Soviet influence collapsed in 1989 and Czechoslovakia once more
became free. The Slovaks and the Czechs agreed to separate
peacefully on 1 January 1993. Slovakia joined both NATO and the EU
in the spring of 2004 and the euro area on 1 January 2009.

Economy ::Slovakia




Economy - overview:


Slovakia has made significant economic reforms since its separation
from the Czech Republic in 1993. Reforms to the taxation,
healthcare, pension, and social welfare systems helped Slovakia to
consolidate its budget and get on track to join the EU in 2004 and
to adopt the euro in January 2009. Major privatizations are nearly
complete, the banking sector is almost entirely in foreign hands,
and the government has helped facilitate a foreign investment boom
with business friendly policies such as labor market liberalization
and a 19% flat tax. Foreign investment in the automotive and
electronic sectors has been strong. Slovakia's economic growth
exceeded expectations in 2001-08 despite the general European
slowdown. Unemployment, at an unacceptable 18% in 2003-04, dropped
to 7.7% in 2008 but remains the economy's Achilles heel. FICO's
cabinet was careful to keep a lid on spending in order to meet euro
adoption criteria and has focused on regulating energy and food
prices instead. To maintain a stable operating environment for
investors, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
advised the Slovak government to refrain from intervening in
important sectors of the economy. However, Bratislava's approach to
mitigating the economic slowdown has included substantial government
intervention and the option to nationalize strategic companies.
Slovakia was admitted to the euro zone in January 2009. RADICOVA's
government, in power since July 2010, has allowed the budget deficit
to rise slightly, to 8.2% of GDP in 2010. GDP fell nearly 5% in 2009
before gaining back 4% in 2010, and unemployment rose above 12% in
2010, as the global recession impacted many segments of the economy.
