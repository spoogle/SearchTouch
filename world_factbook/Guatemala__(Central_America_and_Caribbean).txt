Guatemala  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Guatemala




Background:


The Mayan civilization flourished in Guatemala and surrounding
regions during the first millennium A.D. After almost three
centuries as a Spanish colony, Guatemala won its independence in
1821. During the second half of the 20th century, it experienced a
variety of military and civilian governments, as well as a 36-year
guerrilla war. In 1996, the government signed a peace agreement
formally ending the conflict, which had left more than 100,000
people dead and had created, by some estimates, some 1 million
refugees.

Economy ::Guatemala




Economy - overview:


Guatemala is the most populous of the Central American countries
with a GDP per capita roughly one-half that of the average for Latin
America and the Caribbean. The agricultural sector accounts for
nearly 15% of GDP and half of the labor force; key agricultural
exports include coffee, sugar, and bananas. The 1996 peace accords,
which ended 36 years of civil war, removed a major obstacle to
foreign investment, and since then Guatemala has pursued important
reforms and macroeconomic stabilization. The Central American Free
Trade Agreement (CAFTA) entered into force in July 2006 spurring
increased investment and diversification of exports, with the
largest increases in ethanol and non-traditional agricultural
exports. While CAFTA has helped improve the investment climate,
concerns over security, the lack of skilled workers and poor
infrastructure continue to hamper foreign direct investment. The
distribution of income remains highly unequal with the richest
decile comprising over 40% of Guatemala's overall consumption. More
than half of the population is below the national poverty line and
15% lives in extreme poverty. Poverty among indigenous groups, which
make up 38% of the population, averages 76% and extreme poverty
rises to 28%. 43% of children under five are chronically
malnourished, one of the highest malnutrition rates in the world.
President COLOM entered into office with the promise to increase
education, healthcare, and rural development, and in April 2008 he
inaugurated a conditional cash transfer program, modeled after
programs in Brazil and Mexico, that provide financial incentives for
poor families to keep their children in school and get regular
health check-ups. Given Guatemala's large expatriate community in
the United States, it is the top remittance recipient in Central
America, with inflows serving as a primary source of foreign income
equivalent to nearly two-thirds of exports. Economic growth fell in
2009 as export demand from US and other Central American markets
fell and foreign investment slowed amid the global recession, but
the economy recovered gradually in 2010 and will likely return to
more normal growth rates by 2012. President COLOM, in his last year
in office, will likely face opposition to economic reform,
particularly over a long-delayed tax reform and an IMF-recommended
reform to strengthen the banking sector. Larger budget deficits and
increased debt can be expected in 2011.

Transnational Issues ::Guatemala




Disputes - international:


annual ministerial meetings under the OAS-initiated Agreement on the
Framework for Negotiations and Confidence Building Measures continue
to address Guatemalan land and maritime claims in Belize and the
Caribbean Sea; the Line of Adjacency created under the 2002
Differendum serves in lieu of the contiguous international boundary
to control squatting in the sparsely inhabited rain forests of
Belize's border region; Mexico must deal with thousands of
impoverished Guatemalans and other Central Americans who cross the
porous border looking for work in Mexico and the United States



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: undetermined (the UN does not estimate there are any IDPs,
although some NGOs estimate over 200,000 IDPs as a result of over
three decades of internal conflict that ended in 1996) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Guatemala is a source, transit, and destination
country for Guatemalans and Central Americans trafficked for the
purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; human
trafficking is a significant and growing problem in the country;
Guatemalan women and children are trafficked within the country for
commercial sexual exploitation, primarily to Mexico and the United
States; Guatemalan men, women, and children are also trafficked
within the country, and to Mexico and the United States, for forced
labor

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a second consecutive year,
Guatemala is on the Tier 2 Watch List for its failure to provide
evidence of increasing efforts to combat trafficking in persons,
particularly with respect to ensuring that trafficking offenders are
appropriately prosecuted for their crimes; while prosecutors
initiated trafficking prosecutions, they continued to face problems
in court with application of Guatemala's comprehensive
anti-trafficking law; the government made modest improvements to its
protection efforts, but assistance remained inadequate overall in
2007 (2008)



Illicit drugs:


major transit country for cocaine and heroin; in 2005, cultivated
100 hectares of opium poppy after reemerging as a potential source
of opium in 2004; potential production of less than 1 metric ton of
pure heroin; marijuana cultivation for mostly domestic consumption;
proximity to Mexico makes Guatemala a major staging area for drugs
(particularly for cocaine); money laundering is a serious problem;
corruption is a major problem
