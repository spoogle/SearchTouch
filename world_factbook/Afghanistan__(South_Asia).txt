Afghanistan  (South Asia)

Introduction ::Afghanistan




Background:


Ahmad Shah DURRANI unified the Pashtun tribes and founded
Afghanistan in 1747. The country served as a buffer between the
British and Russian Empires until it won independence from notional
British control in 1919. A brief experiment in democracy ended in a
1973 coup and a 1978 Communist counter-coup. The Soviet Union
invaded in 1979 to support the tottering Afghan Communist regime,
touching off a long and destructive war. The USSR withdrew in 1989
under relentless pressure by internationally supported
anti-Communist mujahedin rebels. A series of subsequent civil wars
saw Kabul finally fall in 1996 to the Taliban, a hardline
Pakistani-sponsored movement that emerged in 1994 to end the
country's civil war and anarchy. Following the 11 September 2001
terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., a US,
Allied, and anti-Taliban Northern Alliance military action toppled
the Taliban for sheltering Osama BIN LADIN. The UN-sponsored Bonn
Conference in 2001 established a process for political
reconstruction that included the adoption of a new constitution, a
presidential election in 2004, and National Assembly elections in
2005. In December 2004, Hamid KARZAI became the first democratically
elected president of Afghanistan and the National Assembly was
inaugurated the following December. Karzai was re-elected in August
2009 for a second term. Despite gains toward building a stable
central government, a resurgent Taliban and continuing provincial
instability - particularly in the south and the east - remain
serious challenges for the Afghan Government.

Economy ::Afghanistan




Economy - overview:


Afghanistan's economy is recovering from decades of conflict. The
economy has improved significantly since the fall of the Taliban
regime in 2001 largely because of the infusion of international
assistance, the recovery of the agricultural sector, and service
sector growth. Despite the progress of the past few years,
Afghanistan is extremely poor, landlocked, and highly dependent on
foreign aid, agriculture, and trade with neighboring countries. Much
of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing,
clean water, electricity, medical care, and jobs. Criminality,
insecurity, weak governance, and the Afghan Government's inability
to extend rule of law to all parts of the country pose challenges to
future economic growth. Afghanistan's living standards are among the
lowest in the world. While the international community remains
committed to Afghanistan's development, pledging over $67 billion at
four donors' conferences since 2002, the Government of Afghanistan
will need to overcome a number of challenges, including low revenue
collection, anemic job creation, high levels of corruption, weak
government capacity, and poor public infrastructure.

Transnational Issues ::Afghanistan

Illicit drugs:


world's largest producer of opium; poppy cultivation decreased 22%
to 157,000 hectares in 2008 but remains at a historically high
level; less favorable growing conditions in 2008 reduced potential
opium production to 5,500 metric tons, down 31 percent from 2007; if
the entire opium crop were processed, 648 metric tons of pure heroin
potentially could be produced; the Taliban and other antigovernment
groups participate in and profit from the opiate trade, which is a
key source of revenue for the Taliban inside Afghanistan; widespread
corruption and instability impede counterdrug efforts; most of the
heroin consumed in Europe and Eurasia is derived from Afghan opium;
vulnerable to drug money laundering through informal financial
networks; regional source of hashish (2008)
