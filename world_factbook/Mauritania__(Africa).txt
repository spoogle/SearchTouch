Mauritania  (Africa)

Introduction ::Mauritania




Background:


Independent from France in 1960, Mauritania annexed the southern
third of the former Spanish Sahara (now Western Sahara) in 1976 but
relinquished it after three years of raids by the Polisario
guerrilla front seeking independence for the territory. Maaouya Ould
Sid Ahmed TAYA seized power in a coup in 1984 and ruled Mauritania
with a heavy hand for more than two decades. A series of
presidential elections that he held were widely seen as flawed. A
bloodless coup in August 2005 deposed President TAYA and ushered in
a military council that oversaw a transition to democratic rule.
Independent candidate Sidi Ould Cheikh ABDALLAHI was inaugurated in
April 2007 as Mauritania's first freely and fairly elected
president. His term ended prematurely in August 2008 when a military
junta led by General Mohamed Ould Abdel AZIZ deposed him and ushered
in a military council government. AZIZ was subsequently elected
president in July 2009. The country continues to experience ethnic
tensions among its black population (Afro-Mauritanians) and white
and black Moor (Arab-Berber) communities, and is having to confront
a growing terrorism threat by al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb
(AQIM).

Economy ::Mauritania




Economy - overview:


Half the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for a
livelihood, even though many of the nomads and subsistence farmers
were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and
1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account
for nearly 40% of total exports. The nation's coastal waters are
among the richest fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by
foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The country's first
deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. Before 2000, drought
and economic mismanagement resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In
February 2000, Mauritania qualified for debt relief under the
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and nearly all of
its foreign debt has since been forgiven. A new investment code
approved in December 2001 improved the opportunities for direct
foreign investment. Mauritania and the IMF agreed to a three-year
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement in 2006.
Mauritania made satisfactory progress, but the IMF, World Bank, and
other international actors suspended assistance and investment in
Mauritania after the August 2008 coup. Since the presidential
election in July 2009, donors have resumed assistance. Oil
prospects, while initially promising, have largely failed to
materialize, and the government has placed a priority on attracting
private investment to spur economic growth. The Government also
emphasizes reduction of poverty, improvement of health and
education, and privatization of the economy.

Transnational Issues ::Mauritania




Disputes - international:

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Mauritania is a source and destination country
for children trafficked for forced labor and sexual exploitation;
slavery-related practices, rooted in ancestral master-slave
relationships, continue to exist in isolated parts of the country;
Mauritanian boys called talibe are trafficked within the country by
religious teachers for forced begging; children are also trafficked
by street gangs within the country that force them to steal, beg,
and sell drugs; girls are trafficked internally for domestic
servitude and sexual exploitation; women and children from
neighboring states are trafficked into Mauritania for purposes of
forced begging, domestic servitude, and sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 3 - the Government of Mauritania does not fully
comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking
and is not making significant efforts to do so; the government did
not show evidence of overall progress in prosecuting and punishing
trafficking offenders, protecting trafficking victims, and
preventing new incidents of trafficking during the past year;
progress that the previous government demonstrated in 2007 through
enactment of strengthened anti-slavery legislation and deepened
political will to eliminate slavery and trafficking has stalled; law
enforcement efforts to address human trafficking including
traditional slavery practices decreased (2009)
