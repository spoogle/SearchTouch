Field Listing :: Refugees and internally displaced persons

  This entry includes those persons residing in a country as refugees
  or internally displaced persons (IDPs). The definition of a refugee
  according to a United Nations Convention is "a person who is outside
  his/her country of nationality or habitual residence; has a
  well-founded fear of persecution because of his/her race, religion,
  nationality, membership in a particular social group or political
  opinion; and is unable or unwilling to avail himself/herself of the
  protection of that country, or to return there, for fear of
  persecution." The UN established the Office of the UN High
  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950 to handle refugee matters
  worldwide. The UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in
  the Near East (UNRWA) has a different operational definition for a
  Palestinian refugee: "a person whose normal place of residence was
  Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948 and who lost
  both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict."
  However, UNHCR also assists some 400,000 Palestinian refugees not
  covered under the UNRWA definition. The term "internally displaced
  person" is not specifically covered in the UN Convention; it is used
  to describe people who have fled their homes for reasons similar to
  refugees, but who remain within their own national territory and are
  subject to the laws of that state.
