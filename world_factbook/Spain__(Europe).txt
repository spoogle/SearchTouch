Spain  (Europe)

Introduction ::Spain




Background:


Spain's powerful world empire of the 16th and 17th centuries
ultimately yielded command of the seas to England. Subsequent
failure to embrace the mercantile and industrial revolutions caused
the country to fall behind Britain, France, and Germany in economic
and political power. Spain remained neutral in World Wars I and II
but suffered through a devastating civil war (1936-39). A peaceful
transition to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco
FRANCO in 1975, and rapid economic modernization (Spain joined the
EU in 1986) gave Spain a dynamic and rapidly growing economy and
made it a global champion of freedom and human rights. The
government continues to battle the Basque Fatherland and Liberty
(ETA) terrorist organization, but its major focus for the immediate
future will be on measures to reverse the severe economic recession
that started in mid-2008.

Economy ::Spain




Economy - overview:


Spain's mixed capitalist economy is the 12th largest in the world,
and its per capita income roughly matches that of Germany and
France. However, after almost 15 years of above average GDP growth,
the Spanish economy began to slow in late 2007 and entered into a
recession in the second quarter of 2008. GDP contracted by 3.7% in
2009, ending a 16-year growth trend, and by another 0.4% in 2010,
making Spain the last major economy to emerge from the global
recession. The reversal in Spain's economic growth reflects a
significant decline in the construction sector, an oversupply of
housing, falling consumer spending, and slumping exports. Government
efforts to boost the economy through stimulus spending, extended
unemployment benefits, and loan guarantees did not prevent a sharp
rise in the unemployment rate, which rose from a low of about 8% in
2007 to 20% in 2010. The government budget deficit worsened from
3.8% of GDP in 2008 to about 9.7% of GDP in 2010, more than three
times the euro-zone limit. Spain's large budget deficit and poor
economic growth prospects have made it vulnerable to financial
contagion from other highly-indebted euro zone members despite the
government's efforts to cut spending, privatize industries, and
boost competitiveness through labor market reforms. Spanish banks'
high exposure to the collapsed domestic construction and real estate
market also poses a continued risk for the sector. The government
intervened in one regional savings bank in 2009, and investors
remain concerned that Madrid may need to bail out more troubled
banks. The Bank of Spain, however, is seeking to boost confidence in
the financial sector by pressuring banks to come clean about their
losses and consolidate into stronger groups.
