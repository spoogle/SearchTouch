Maldives  (South Asia)

Introduction ::Maldives




Background:


The Maldives was long a sultanate, first under Dutch and then under
British protection. It became a republic in 1968, three years after
independence. President Maumoon Abdul GAYOOM dominated the islands'
political scene for 30 years, elected to six successive terms by
single-party referendums. Following riots in the capital Male in
August 2004, the president and his government pledged to embark upon
democratic reforms including a more representative political system
and expanded political freedoms. Progress was sluggish, however, and
many promised reforms were slow to be realized. Nonetheless,
political parties were legalized in 2005. In June 2008, a
constituent assembly - termed the "Special Majlis" - finalized a new
constitution, which was ratified by the president in August. The
first-ever presidential elections under a multi-candidate,
multi-party system were held in October 2008. GAYOOM was defeated in
a runoff poll by Mohamed NASHEED, a political activist who had been
jailed several years earlier by the former regime. Challenges facing
the new president include strengthening democracy and combating
poverty and drug abuse. Maldives officials have been prominent
participants in international climate change talks due to the
islands' low elevation and the threat from sea-level rise.

Economy ::Maldives




Economy - overview:


Tourism, Maldives' largest economic activity, accounts for 28% of
GDP and more than 60% of foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of
government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related
taxes. Fishing is the second leading sector. Agriculture and
manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy,
constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the
shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must be imported. The
Maldivian Government implemented economic reforms, beginning in 1989
that initially lifted import quotas, opened some exports to the
private sector, and liberalized regulations to allow more foreign
investment. Real GDP growth averaged over 7.5% per year for more
than a decade, and registered 18% in 2006, due to a rebound in
tourism and reconstruction following the tsunami of December 2004.
GDP slowed in 2007-08, then contracted in 2009 due to the global
recession. Falling tourist arrivals and fish exports, combined with
high government spending on social needs, subsidies, and civil
servant salaries contributed to a balance of payments crisis, which
was eased with a December 2009, $79.3 million dollar IMF standby
agreement. Diversifying the economy beyond tourism and fishing,
reforming public finance, and increasing employment opportunities
are major challenges facing the government. Over the longer term
Maldivian authorities worry about the impact of erosion and possible
global warming on their low-lying country; 80% of the area is 1
meter or less above sea level.
