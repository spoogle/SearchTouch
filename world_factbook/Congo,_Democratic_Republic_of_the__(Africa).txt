Congo, Democratic Republic of the  (Africa)

Introduction ::Congo, Democratic Republic of the




Background:


Established as a Belgian colony in 1908, the Republic of the Congo
gained its independence in 1960, but its early years were marred by
political and social instability. Col. Joseph MOBUTU seized power
and declared himself president in a November 1965 coup. He
subsequently changed his name - to MOBUTU Sese Seko - as well as
that of the country - to Zaire. MOBUTU retained his position for 32
years through several sham elections, as well as through brutal
force. Ethnic strife and civil war, touched off by a massive inflow
of refugees in 1994 from fighting in Rwanda and Burundi, led in May
1997 to the toppling of the MOBUTU regime by a rebellion backed by
Rwanda and Uganda and fronted by Laurent KABILA. He renamed the
country the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but in August
1998 his regime was itself challenged by a second insurrection again
backed by Rwanda and Uganda. Troops from Angola, Chad, Namibia,
Sudan, and Zimbabwe intervened to support KABILA's regime. A
cease-fire was signed in July 1999 by the DRC, Congolese armed rebel
groups, Angola, Namibia, Rwanda, Uganda, and Zimbabwe but sporadic
fighting continued. Laurent KABILA was assassinated in January 2001
and his son, Joseph KABILA, was named head of state. In October
2002, the new president was successful in negotiating the withdrawal
of Rwandan forces occupying eastern Congo; two months later, the
Pretoria Accord was signed by all remaining warring parties to end
the fighting and establish a government of national unity. A
transitional government was set up in July 2003. Joseph KABILA as
president and four vice presidents represented the former
government, former rebel groups, the political opposition, and civil
society. The transitional government held a successful
constitutional referendum in December 2005 and elections for the
presidency, National Assembly, and provincial legislatures in 2006.
The National Assembly was installed in September 2006 and KABILA was
inaugurated president in December 2006. Provincial assemblies were
constituted in early 2007, and elected governors and national
senators in January 2007.

the city of Goma, home to a quarter of a million people; the volcano
produces unusually fast-moving lava, known to travel up to 100 km
(60 mi)/hr; Nyiragongo has been deemed a "Decade Volcano" by the
International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the
Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to its explosive history and
close proximity to human populations; its neighbor, Nyamuragira,
which erupted in 2010, is Africa's most active volcano; Visoke is
the only other historically active volcano

Economy ::Congo, Democratic Republic of the




Economy - overview:


The economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo - a nation
endowed with vast potential wealth - is slowly recovering from
decades of decline. Systemic corruption since independence in 1960
and conflict that began in May 1997 has dramatically reduced
national output and government revenue, increased external debt, and
resulted in the deaths of more than 5 million people from violence,
famine, and disease. Foreign businesses curtailed operations due to
uncertainty about the outcome of the conflict, lack of
infrastructure, and the difficult operating environment. Conditions
began to improve in late 2002 with the withdrawal of a large portion
of the invading foreign troops. The transitional government reopened
relations with international financial institutions and
international donors, and President KABILA began implementing
reforms. Progress has been slow and the International Monetary Fund
curtailed their program for the DRC at the end of March 2006 because
of fiscal overruns. Much economic activity still occurs in the
informal sector, and is not reflected in GDP data. Renewed activity
in the mining sector, the source of most export income, boosted
Kinshasa's fiscal position and GDP growth from 2006-2008, however,
the government's review of mining contracts that began in 2006,
combined with a fall in world market prices for the DRC's key
mineral exports temporarily weakened output in 2009, leading to a
balance of payments crisis. The recovery in mineral prices beginning
in mid 2009 boosted mineral exports, and emergency funds from the
IMF boosted foreign reserves. An uncertain legal framework,
corruption, a lack of transparency in government policy are
long-term problems for the mining sector and the economy as a whole.
The global recession cut economic growth in 2009 to less than half
its 2008 level, but growth returned to 3% in 2010. The DRC signed a
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the IMF in 2009 and
received $12 billion in multilateral and bilateral debt relief in
2010.

Telephone system:


general assessment: barely adequate wire and microwave radio relay
service in and between urban areas; domestic satellite system with
14 earth stations; inadequate fixed line infrastructure

domestic: state-owned operator providing less than 1 fixed-line
connection per 1000 persons; given the backdrop of a wholly
inadequate fixed-line infrastructure, the use of mobile-cellular
services has surged and subscribership in 2009 exceeded 10 million -
roughly 15 per 100 persons

Transnational Issues ::Congo, Democratic Republic of the




Disputes - international:


heads of the Great Lakes states and UN pledged in 2004 to abate
tribal, rebel, and militia fighting in the region, including
northeast Congo, where the UN Organization Mission in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (MONUC), organized in 1999, maintains over
16,500 uniformed peacekeepers; members of Uganda's Lords Resistance
Army forces continue to seek refuge in Congo's Garamba National Park
as peace talks with the Uganda government evolve; the location of
the boundary in the broad Congo River with the Republic of the Congo
is indefinite except in the Pool Malebo/Stanley Pool area; Uganda
and DROC dispute Rukwanzi island in Lake Albert and other areas on
the Semliki River with hydrocarbon potential; boundary commission
continues discussions over Congolese-administered triangle of land
on the right bank of the Lunkinda river claimed by Zambia near the
DROC village of Pweto

Congo)

IDPs: 1.4 million (fighting between government forces and rebels
since mid-1990s; most IDPs are in eastern provinces) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Democratic Republic of the Congo is a source and
destination country for men, women, and children subjected to
trafficking for the purposes of forced labor and forced
prostitution; the majority of this trafficking is internal, and much
of it is perpetrated by armed groups and government forces outside
government control within the country's unstable eastern provinces

tier rating: Tier 3 - Government of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the
elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to
do so; the government did not show evidence of progress in
prosecuting and punishing labor or sex trafficking offenders,
including members of its own armed forces; providing protective
services for the vast majority of trafficking victims; or raising
public awareness of human trafficking; in addition, the government's
anti-trafficking law enforcement efforts decreased during the
reporting period (2010)



Illicit drugs:


one of Africa's biggest producers of cannabis, but mostly for
domestic consumption; traffickers exploit lax shipping controls to
transit pseudoephedrine through the capital; while rampant
corruption and inadequate supervision leaves the banking system
vulnerable to money laundering, the lack of a well-developed
financial system limits the country's utility as a money-laundering
center (2008)
