Kazakhstan  (Central Asia)

Introduction ::Kazakhstan




Background:


Ethnic Kazakhs, a mix of Turkic and Mongol nomadic tribes who
migrated into the region in the 13th century, were rarely united as
a single nation. The area was conquered by Russia in the 18th
century, and Kazakhstan became a Soviet Republic in 1936. During the
1950s and 1960s agricultural "Virgin Lands" program, Soviet citizens
were encouraged to help cultivate Kazakhstan's northern pastures.
This influx of immigrants (mostly Russians, but also some other
deported nationalities) skewed the ethnic mixture and enabled
non-ethnic Kazakhs to outnumber natives. Independence in 1991 drove
many of these newcomers to emigrate. Kazakhstan's economy is larger
than those of all the other Central Asian states largely due to the
country's vast natural resources. Current issues include: developing
a cohesive national identity; expanding the development of the
country's vast energy resources and exporting them to world markets;
diversifying the economy outside the oil, gas, and mining sectors;
enhancing Kazakhstan's economic competitiveness; developing a
multiparty parliament and advancing political and social reform; and
strengthening relations with neighboring states and other foreign
powers.

Central Asia, northwest of China; a small portion west of the Ural
(Zhayyq) River in eastern-most Europe

Area:


total: 2,724,900 sq km
country comparison to the world: 9
land: 2,699,700 sq km

water: 25,200 sq km



Area - comparative:


slightly less than four times the size of Texas



Land boundaries:


total: 12,185 km

border countries: China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,224 km, Russia 6,846
km, Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km



Coastline:


0 km (landlocked); note - Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea, now split
into two bodies of water (1,070 km), and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km)



Maritime claims:


none (landlocked)



Climate:


continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid



Terrain:


vast flat steppe extending from the Volga in the west to the Altai
Mountains in the east and from the plains of western Siberia in the
north to oases and deserts of Central Asia in the south



Elevation extremes:


lowest point: Vpadina Kaundy -132 m

highest point: Khan Tangiri Shyngy (Pik Khan-Tengri) 6,995 m



Natural resources:


major deposits of petroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, manganese,
chrome ore, nickel, cobalt, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, bauxite,
gold, uranium



Land use:


arable land: 8.28%

permanent crops: 0.05%

other: 91.67% (2005)



Irrigated land:

Natural hazards:


earthquakes in the south; mudslides around Almaty



Environment - current issues:


radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with former defense
industries and test ranges scattered throughout the country pose
health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe
in some cities; because the two main rivers that flowed into the
Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and
leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural
salts; these substances are then picked up by the wind and blown
into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil
pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and salination from
poor infrastructure and wasteful irrigation practices



Environment - international agreements:


party to: Air Pollution, Biodiversity, Climate Change,
Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification,
Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands

signed, but not ratified: Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol



Geography - note:


landlocked; Russia leases approximately 6,000 sq km of territory
enclosing the Baykonur Cosmodrome; in January 2004, Kazakhstan and
Russia extended the lease to 2050

a gold sun with 32 rays above a soaring golden steppe eagle, both
centered on a sky blue background; the hoist side displays a
national ornamental pattern "koshkar-muiz" (the horns of the ram) in
gold; the blue color is of religious significance to the Turkic
peoples of the country, and so symbolizes cultural and ethnic unity;
it also represents the endless sky as well as water; the sun, a
source of life and energy, exemplifies wealth and plenitude; the
sun's rays are shaped like grain, which is the basis of abundance
and prosperity; the eagle has appeared on the flags of Kazakh tribes
for centuries and represents freedom, power, and the flight to the
future

Economy ::Kazakhstan




Economy - overview:


Kazakhstan, geographically the largest of the former Soviet
republics, excluding Russia, possesses enormous fossil fuel reserves
and plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals, such as
uranium, copper, and zinc. It also has a large agricultural sector
featuring livestock and grain. Kazakhstan's industrial sector is
primarily focused on the extraction and processing of these natural
resources. Kazakhstan enjoyed double-digit growth in 2000-01 and 8%
or more per year in 2002-07 - thanks largely to its booming energy
sector but also to economic reform, good harvests, and increased
foreign investment; GDP growth slowed dramatically following the
near-collapse of the banking sector in late 2007 and the declines in
oil and metals prices associated with the global economic downturn
in 2008-09. Kazakhstan has embarked upon an industrial policy
designed to diversify the economy away from overdependence on the
oil sector as well expanding export markets away from its historical
reliance on Russia. Nevertheless, growth is still driven by oil. The
government has engaged in several disputes with Western oil
companies over the terms of production agreements, most recently,
with regard to the Kashagan project in 2007-08 and the Karachaganak
project in 2009.
