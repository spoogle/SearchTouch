Bulgaria  (Europe)

Introduction ::Bulgaria




Background:


The Bulgars, a Central Asian Turkic tribe, merged with the local
Slavic inhabitants in the late 7th century to form the first
Bulgarian state. In succeeding centuries, Bulgaria struggled with
the Byzantine Empire to assert its place in the Balkans, but by the
end of the 14th century the country was overrun by the Ottoman
Turks. Northern Bulgaria attained autonomy in 1878 and all of
Bulgaria became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1908. Having
fought on the losing side in both World Wars, Bulgaria fell within
the Soviet sphere of influence and became a People's Republic in
1946. Communist domination ended in 1990, when Bulgaria held its
first multiparty election since World War II and began the
contentious process of moving toward political democracy and a
market economy while combating inflation, unemployment, corruption,
and crime. The country joined NATO in 2004 and the EU in 2007.

Economy ::Bulgaria




Economy - overview:


Bulgaria, a former Communist country that entered the EU on 1
January 2007, averaged more than 6% growth from 2004 to 2008, driven
by significant amounts of foreign direct investment and consumption.
Successive governments have demonstrated a commitment to economic
reforms and responsible fiscal planning, but the global downturn
sharply reduced domestic demand, exports, capital inflows, and
industrial production. GDP contracted by approximately 5% in 2009,
and stagnated in 2010, despite a significant recovery in exports.
The economy is expected to grow modestly in 2011, however.
Corruption in the public administration, a weak judiciary, and the
presence of organized crime remain significant challenges.
