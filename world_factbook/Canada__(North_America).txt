Canada  (North America)

Introduction ::Canada




Background:


A land of vast distances and rich natural resources, Canada became a
self-governing dominion in 1867 while retaining ties to the British
crown. Economically and technologically the nation has developed in
parallel with the US, its neighbor to the south across an
unfortified border. Canada faces the political challenges of meeting
public demands for quality improvements in health care and education
services, as well as responding to the particular concerns of
predominantly francophone Quebec. Canada also aims to develop its
diverse energy resources while maintaining its commitment to the
environment.

north, north of the conterminous US



Geographic coordinates:


60 00 N, 95 00 W

Area:


total: 9,984,670 sq km
country comparison to the world: 2
land: 9,093,507 sq km

water: 891,163 sq km



Area - comparative:


slightly larger than the US



Land boundaries:


total: 8,893 km

border countries: US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska)



Coastline:


202,080 km



Maritime claims:


territorial sea: 12 nm

contiguous zone: 24 nm

exclusive economic zone: 200 nm

continental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin



Climate:


varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north



Terrain:


mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast



Elevation extremes:

Natural hazards:


continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development;
cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the
mixing of air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and North American
interior, and produce most of the country's rain and snow east of
the mountains

volcanism: the vast majority of volcanoes in Western Canada's Coast
Mountains remain dormant



Environment - current issues:


air pollution and resulting acid rain severely affecting lakes and
damaging forests; metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and
vehicle emissions impacting on agricultural and forest productivity;
ocean waters becoming contaminated due to agricultural, industrial,
mining, and forestry activities

Economy ::Canada




Economy - overview:


As an affluent, high-tech industrial society in the trillion-dollar
class, Canada resembles the US in its market-oriented economic
system, pattern of production, and affluent living standards. Since
World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining,
and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. The 1989 US-Canada
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and the 1994 North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) (which includes Mexico) touched off a dramatic
increase in trade and economic integration with the US, its
principal trading partner. Canada enjoys a substantial trade surplus
with the US, which absorbs about three-fourths of Canadian exports
each year. Canada is the US's largest foreign supplier of energy,
including oil, gas, uranium, and electric power. Given its great
natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant,
Canada enjoyed solid economic growth from 1993 through 2007.
Buffeted by the global economic crisis, the economy dropped into a
sharp recession in the final months of 2008, and Ottawa posted its
first fiscal deficit in 2009 after 12 years of surplus. Canada's
major banks, however, emerged from the financial crisis of 2008-09
among the strongest in the world, owing to the country's tradition
of conservative lending practices and strong capitalization. During
2010, Canada's economy grew only 3%, because of weak exports.
