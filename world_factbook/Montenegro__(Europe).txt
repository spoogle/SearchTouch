Montenegro  (Europe)

Introduction ::Montenegro




Background:


The use of the name Montenegro began in the 15th century when the
Crnojevic dynasty began to rule the Serbian principality of Zeta;
over subsequent centuries Montenegro was able to maintain its
independence from the Ottoman Empire. From the 16th to 19th
centuries, Montenegro became a theocracy ruled by a series of bishop
princes; in 1852, it was transformed into a secular principality.
After World War I, Montenegro was absorbed by the Kingdom of Serbs,
Croats, and Slovenes, which became the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in
1929; at the conclusion of World War II, it became a constituent
republic of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When the
latter dissolved in 1992, Montenegro federated with Serbia, first as
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and, after 2003, in a looser
union of Serbia and Montenegro. In May 2006, Montenegro invoked its
right under the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro to
hold a referendum on independence from the state union. The vote for
severing ties with Serbia exceeded 55% - the threshold set by the EU
- allowing Montenegro to formally declare its independence on 3 June
2006.

Economy ::Montenegro




Economy - overview:


Montenegro severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia
during the MILOSEVIC era and maintained its own central bank,
adopted the Deutchmark, then the euro - rather than the Yugoslav
dinar - as official currency, collected customs tariffs, and managed
its own budget. The dissolution of the loose political union between
Serbia and Montenegro in 2006 led to separate membership in several
international financial institutions, such as the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development. In January 2007, Montenegro joined
the World Bank and IMF. Montenegro is pursuing its own membership in
the World Trade Organization and signed a Stabilization and
Association agreement with the European Union in October 2007. The
European Council granted candidate country status to Montenegro at
the December 2010 session. Unemployment and regional disparities in
development are key political and economic problems. Montenegro has
privatized its large aluminum complex - the dominant industry - as
well as most of its financial sector, and has begun to attract
foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The global
financial crisis has had a significant negative impact on the
economy, due to the ongoing credit crunch, a decline in the real
estate sector, and a fall in aluminum exports.
