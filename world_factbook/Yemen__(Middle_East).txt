Yemen  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Yemen




Background:


North Yemen became independent of the Ottoman Empire in 1918. The
British, who had set up a protectorate area around the southern port
of Aden in the 19th century, withdrew in 1967 from what became South
Yemen. Three years later, the southern government adopted a Marxist
orientation. The massive exodus of hundreds of thousands of Yemenis
from the south to the north contributed to two decades of hostility
between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the
Republic of Yemen in 1990. A southern secessionist movement in 1994
was quickly subdued. In 2000, Saudi Arabia and Yemen agreed to a
delimitation of their border.

Economy ::Yemen




Economy - overview:


Yemen is a low income country that is highly dependent on declining
oil resources for revenue. Petroleum accounts for roughly 25% of GDP
and 70% of government revenue. Yemen has tried to counter the
effects of its declining oil resources by diversifying its economy
through an economic reform program initiated in 2006 that is
designed to bolster non-oil sectors of the economy and foreign
investment. In October 2009, Yemen exported its first liquefied
natural gas as part of this diversification effort. In January 2010,
the international community established the Friends of Yemen group
that aims to support Yemen's efforts towards economic and political
reform, and in August 2010 the IMF approved a three-year $370
million program to further this effort. Despite these ambitious
endeavors, Yemen continues to face difficult long term challenges,
including declining water resources and a high population growth
rate.
