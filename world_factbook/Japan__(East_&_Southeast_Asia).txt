Japan  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Japan




Background:


In 1603, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate (a
military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of
relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence.
For more than two centuries this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a
flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after
signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in 1854 and began to
intensively modernize and industrialize. During the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to
defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea,
Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In 1931-32 Japan
occupied Manchuria, and in 1937 it launched a full-scale invasion of
China. Japan attacked US forces in 1941 - triggering America's entry
into World War II - and soon occupied much of East and Southeast
Asia. After its defeat in World War II, Japan recovered to become an
economic power and an ally of the US. While the emperor retains his
throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold
actual decision-making power. Following three decades of
unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown
starting in the 1990s, but the country remains a major economic
power.

Coastline:


29,751 km



Maritime claims:


territorial sea: 12 nm; between 3 nm and 12 nm in the international
straits - La Perouse or Soya, Tsugaru, Osumi, and Eastern and
Western Channels of the Korea or Tsushima Strait

contiguous zone: 24 nm

exclusive economic zone: 200 nm



Climate:


varies from tropical in south to cool temperate in north



Terrain:


mostly rugged and mountainous



Elevation extremes:


lowest point: Hachiro-gata -4 m

highest point: Fujiyama 3,776 m



Natural resources:


negligible mineral resources, fish

note: with virtually no energy natural resources, Japan is the
world's largest importer of coal and liquefied natural gas, as well
as the second largest importer of oil



Land use:


arable land: 11.64%

permanent crops: 0.9%

other: 87.46% (2005)



Irrigated land:


25,920 sq km (2003)



Total renewable water resources:


430 cu km (1999)

Natural hazards:


many dormant and some active volcanoes; about 1,500 seismic
occurrences (mostly tremors) every year; tsunamis; typhoons

volcanism: both Unzen (elev. 1,500 m, 4,621 ft) and Sakura-jima
(elev. 1,117 m, 3,665 ft), which lies near the densely populated
city of Kagoshima, have been deemed "Decade Volcanoes" by the
International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the
Earth's Interior, worthy of study due to their explosive history and
close proximity to human populations; other notable historically
active volcanoes include Asama, Honshu Island's most active volcano,
Aso, Bandai, Fuji, Iwo-Jima, Kikai, Kirishima, Komaga-take, Oshima,
Suwanosejima, Tokachi, Yake-dake, and Usu



Environment - current issues:


air pollution from power plant emissions results in acid rain;
acidification of lakes and reservoirs degrading water quality and
threatening aquatic life; Japan is one of the largest consumers of
fish and tropical timber, contributing to the depletion of these
resources in Asia and elsewhere

Economy ::Japan




Economy - overview:


In the years following World War II, government-industry
cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high technology, and a
comparatively small defense allocation (1% of GDP) helped Japan
develop a technologically advanced economy. Two notable
characteristics of the post-war economy were the close interlocking
structures of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors, known as
keiretsu, and the guarantee of lifetime employment for a substantial
portion of the urban labor force. Both features are now eroding
under the dual pressures of global competition and domestic
demographic change. Japan's industrial sector is heavily dependent
on imported raw materials and fuels. A tiny agricultural sector is
highly subsidized and protected, with crop yields among the highest
in the world. Usually self sufficient in rice, Japan imports about
60% of its food on a caloric basis. Japan maintains one of the
world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
global catch. For three decades, overall real economic growth had
been spectacular - a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the
1970s, and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed markedly in the
1990s, averaging just 1.7%, largely because of the after effects of
inefficient investment and an asset price bubble in the late 1980s
that required a protracted period of time for firms to reduce excess
debt, capital, and labor. The Japanese financial sector was not
heavily exposed to sub-prime mortgages or their derivative
instruments and weathered the initial effect of the recent global
credit crunch, but a sharp downturn in business investment and
global demand for Japan's exports in late 2008 pushed Japan further
into recession. Government stimulus spending helped the economy
recover in late 2009 and 2010, but Tokyo is warning that GDP growth
will slow in 2011. Prime Minister Kan's government has proposed
opening the agricultural and services sectors to greater foreign
competition and boosting exports through free-trade agreements, but
debate continues on restructuring the economy and funding new
stimulus programs in the face of a tight fiscal situation. Japan's
huge government debt, which is approaching 200 percent of GDP,
persistent deflation, and an aging and shrinking population are
major complications for the economy.
