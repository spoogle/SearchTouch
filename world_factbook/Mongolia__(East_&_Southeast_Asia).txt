Mongolia  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Mongolia




Background:


The Mongols gained fame in the 13th century when under Chinggis
KHAAN they established a huge Eurasian empire through conquest.
After his death the empire was divided into several powerful Mongol
states, but these broke apart in the 14th century. The Mongols
eventually retired to their original steppe homelands and in the
late 17th century came under Chinese rule. Mongolia won its
independence in 1921 with Soviet backing and a Communist regime was
installed in 1924. The modern country of Mongolia, however,
represents only part of the Mongols' historical homeland; more
ethnic Mongolians live in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in
the People's Republic of China than in Mongolia. Following a
peaceful democratic revolution, the ex-Communist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) won elections in 1990 and 1992, but was
defeated by the Democratic Union Coalition (DUC) in the 1996
parliamentary election. The MPRP won an overwhelming majority in the
2000 parliamentary election, but the party lost seats in the 2004
election and shared power with democratic coalition parties from
2004-08. The MPRP regained a solid majority in the 2008
parliamentary elections but nevertheless formed a coalition
government with the Democratic Party. In 2010 the MPRP voted to
retake the name of the Mongolian People's Party (MPP), a name it
used in the early 1920s. The prime minister and most cabinet members
are MPP members.

Economy ::Mongolia




Economy - overview:


Economic activity in Mongolia has traditionally been based on
herding and agriculture - Mongolia's extensive mineral deposits,
however, have attracted foreign investors. The country holds copper,
gold, coal, molybdenum, fluorspar, uranium, tin, and tungsten
deposits, which account for a large part of foreign direct
investment and government revenues. Soviet assistance, at its height
one-third of GDP, disappeared almost overnight in 1990 and 1991 at
the time of the dismantlement of the USSR. The following decade saw
Mongolia endure both deep recession, because of political inaction
and natural disasters, as well as economic growth, because of
reform-embracing, free-market economics and extensive privatization
of the formerly state-run economy. Severe winters and summer
droughts in 2000-02 resulted in massive livestock die-off and zero
or negative GDP growth. This was compounded by falling prices for
Mongolia's primary sector exports and widespread opposition to
privatization. Growth averaged nearly 9% per year in 2004-08 largely
because of high copper prices and new gold production. In 2008
Mongolia experienced a soaring inflation rate with year-to-year
inflation reaching nearly 30% - the highest inflation rate in over a
decade. By late 2008, as the country began to feel the effects of
the global financial crisis, falling commodity prices helped lower
inflation, but also reduced government revenues and forced cuts in
spending. In early 2009, the International Monetary Fund reached a
$236 million Stand-by Arrangement with Mongolia, and the country has
started to move out of the crisis. Although the banking sector
remains unstable, the government is now enforcing stricter
supervision regulations. In October 2009, the government passed
long-awaited legislation on an investment agreement to develop
Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi mine, considered to be one of the world's
largest untapped copper deposits. The economy grew an estimated 7%
in 2010, largely on the strength of exports to nearby countries, and
international reserves reached $1.6 billion in September, an all
time high for Mongolia. Mongolia's economy continues to be heavily
influenced by its neighbors. Mongolia purchases 95% of its petroleum
products and a substantial amount of electric power from Russia,
leaving it vulnerable to price increases. Trade with China
represents more than half of Mongolia's total external trade - China
receives about two-thirds of Mongolia's exports. Remittances from
Mongolians working abroad are sizable, but have fallen due to the
economic crisis; money laundering is a growing concern. Mongolia
joined the World Trade Organization in 1997 and seeks to expand its
participation in regional economic and trade regimes.
