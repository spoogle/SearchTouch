Uruguay  (South America)

Introduction ::Uruguay




Background:


Montevideo, founded by the Spanish in 1726 as a military stronghold,
soon took advantage of its natural harbor to become an important
commercial center. Claimed by Argentina but annexed by Brazil in
1821, Uruguay declared its independence four years later and secured
its freedom in 1828 after a three-year struggle. The administrations
of President Jose BATLLE in the early 20th century established
widespread political, social, and economic reforms that established
a statist tradition. A violent Marxist urban guerrilla movement
named the Tupamaros, launched in the late 1960s, led Uruguay's
president to cede control of the government to the military in 1973.
By yearend, the rebels had been crushed, but the military continued
to expand its hold over the government. Civilian rule was not
restored until 1985. In 2004, the left-of-center Frente Amplio
Coalition won national elections that effectively ended 170 years of
political control previously held by the Colorado and Blanco
parties. Uruguay's political and labor conditions are among the
freest on the continent.

Economy ::Uruguay




Economy - overview:


Uruguay's economy is characterized by an export-oriented
agricultural sector, a well-educated work force, and high levels of
social spending. After averaging growth of 5% annually during
1996-98, in 1999-2002 the economy suffered a major downturn,
stemming largely from the spillover effects of the economic problems
of its large neighbors, Argentina and Brazil. In 2001-02, Argentine
citizens made massive withdrawals of dollars deposited in Uruguayan
banks after bank deposits in Argentina were frozen, which led to a
plunge in the Uruguayan peso, a banking crisis, and a sharp economic
contraction. Real GDP fell in four years by nearly 20%, with 2002
the worst year. The unemployment rate rose, inflation surged, and
the burden of external debt doubled. Financial assistance from the
IMF helped stem the damage. Uruguay restructured its external debt
in 2003 without asking creditors to accept a reduction on the
principal. Economic growth for Uruguay resumed, and averaged 8%
annually during the period 2004-08. The 2008-09 global financial
crisis put a brake on Uruguay's vigorous growth, which decelerated
to 2.9% in 2009. Nevertheless, the country managed to avoid a
recession and keep positive growth rates, mainly through higher
public expenditure and investment, and GDP growth exceeded 7% in
2010.
