Grenada  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Grenada




Background:


Carib Indians inhabited Grenada when COLUMBUS discovered the island
in 1498, but it remained uncolonized for more than a century. The
French settled Grenada in the 17th century, established sugar
estates, and imported large numbers of African slaves. Britain took
the island in 1762 and vigorously expanded sugar production. In the
19th century, cacao eventually surpassed sugar as the main export
crop; in the 20th century, nutmeg became the leading export. In
1967, Britain gave Grenada autonomy over its internal affairs. Full
independence was attained in 1974 making Grenada one of the smallest
independent countries in the Western Hemisphere. Grenada was seized
by a Marxist military council on 19 October 1983. Six days later the
island was invaded by US forces and those of six other Caribbean
nations, which quickly captured the ringleaders and their hundreds
of Cuban advisers. Free elections were reinstituted the following
year and have continued since that time. Hurricane Ivan struck
Grenada in September of 2004 causing severe damage.

Economy ::Grenada




Economy - overview:


Grenada relies on tourism as its main source of foreign exchange
especially since the construction of an international airport in
1985. Hurricanes Ivan (2004) and Emily (2005) severely damaged the
agricultural sector - particularly nutmeg and cocoa cultivation -
which had been a key driver of economic growth. Grenada has
rebounded from the devastating effects of the hurricanes but is now
saddled with the debt burden from the rebuilding process. Public
debt-to-GDP is nearly 110%, leaving the THOMAS administration
limited room to engage in public investments and social spending.
Strong performances in construction and manufacturing, together with
the development of tourism and an offshore financial industry, have
also contributed to growth in national output; however, economic
growth was stagnant in 2010 after a sizeable contraction in 2009,
because of the global economic slowdown's effects on tourism and
remittances.
