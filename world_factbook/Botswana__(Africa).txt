Botswana  (Africa)

Introduction ::Botswana




Background:


Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted
its new name upon independence in 1966. Four decades of
uninterrupted civilian leadership, progressive social policies, and
significant capital investment have created one of the most dynamic
economies in Africa. Mineral extraction, principally diamond mining,
dominates economic activity, though tourism is a growing sector due
to the country's conservation practices and extensive nature
preserves. Botswana has one of the world's highest known rates of
HIV/AIDS infection, but also one of Africa's most progressive and
comprehensive programs for dealing with the disease.

Economy ::Botswana




Economy - overview:


Botswana has maintained one of the world's highest economic growth
rates since independence in 1966, though growth fell below 5% in
2007-08, and turned sharply negative in 2009, with industry falling
nearly 30%. Through fiscal discipline and sound management, Botswana
transformed itself from one of the poorest countries in the world to
a middle-income country with a per capita GDP of $13,100 in 2010.
Two major investment services rank Botswana as the best credit risk
in Africa. Diamond mining has fueled much of the expansion and
currently accounts for more than one-third of GDP, 70-80% of export
earnings, and about half of the government's revenues. Botswana's
heavy reliance on a single luxury export was a critical factor in
the sharp economic contraction of 2009. Tourism, financial services,
subsistence farming, and cattle raising are other key sectors.
Although unemployment was 7.5% in 2007 according to official
reports, unofficial estimates place it closer to 40%. The prevalence
of HIV/AIDS is second highest in the world and threatens Botswana's
impressive economic gains. An expected leveling off in diamond
mining production within the next two decades overshadows long-term
prospects.
