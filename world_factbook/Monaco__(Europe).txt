Monaco  (Europe)

Introduction ::Monaco




Background:


The Genoese built a fortress on the site of present day Monaco in
1215. The current ruling Grimaldi family first seized temporary
control in 1297, and again in 1331, but were not able to permanently
secure their holding until 1419. Economic development was spurred in
the late 19th century with a railroad linkup to France and the
opening of a casino. Since then, the principality's mild climate,
splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world
famous as a tourist and recreation center.

Economy ::Monaco




Economy - overview:


Monaco, bordering France on the Mediterranean coast, is a popular
resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The
principality also is a major banking center and has successfully
sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,
nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low
business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who
have established residence and for foreign companies that have set
up businesses and offices. Monaco, however, is not a tax-free
shelter; it charges nearly 20% value-added tax, collects stamp
duties, and companies face a 33% tax on profits unless they can show
that three-quarters of profits are generated within the
principality. Monaco was formally removed from the OECD's "grey
list" of uncooperative tax jurisdictions in late 2009, but continues
to face international pressure to abandon its banking secrecy laws
and help combat tax evasion. The state retains monopolies in a
number of sectors, including tobacco, the telephone network, and the
postal service. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to
those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.
