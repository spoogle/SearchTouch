Field Listing :: Merchant marine

  Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage
  of goods; or all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary
  ships), which excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs,
  etc. This entry contains information in four fields - total, ships
  by type, foreign-owned, and registered in other countries.
  Total includes the number of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT
  for those ships, and total GRT for those ships. DWT or dead weight
  tonnage is the total weight of cargo, plus bunkers, stores, etc.,
  that a ship can carry when immersed to the appropriate load line.
  GRT or gross register tonnage is a figure obtained by measuring the
  entire sheltered volume of a ship available for cargo and passengers
  and converting it to tons on the basis of 100 cubic feet per ton;
  there is no stable relationship between GRT and DWT.
  Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo
  ships, cargo ships, chemical tankers, combination bulk carriers,
  combination ore/oil carriers, container ships, liquefied gas
  tankers, livestock carriers, multifunctional large-load carriers,
  petroleum tankers, passenger ships, passenger/cargo ships, railcar
  carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships,
  short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, and vehicle carriers.
  Foreign-owned are ships that fly the flag of one country but belong
  to owners in another.
  Registered in other countries are ships that belong to owners in one
  country but fly the flag of another.
