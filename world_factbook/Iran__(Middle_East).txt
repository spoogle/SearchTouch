Iran  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Iran




Background:


Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979
after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza
PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces
established a theocratic system of government with ultimate
political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred
to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the
constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a
popularly elected 86-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations
have been strained since a group of Iranian students seized the US
Embassy in Tehran on 4 November 1979 and held it until 20 January
1981. During 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq
that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes
between US Navy and Iranian military forces between 1987 and 1988.
Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism for its
activities in Lebanon and elsewhere in the world and remains subject
to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of
its continued involvement in terrorism and its nuclear weapons
ambitions. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam
Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles
(legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in
response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement
floundered as conservative politicians, through the control of
unelected institutions, prevented reform measures from being enacted
and increased repressive measures. Starting with nationwide
municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections
in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected
government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005
inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His
controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests
over allegations of electoral fraud. The UN Security Council has
passed a number of resolutions (1696 in July 2006, 1737 in December
2006, 1747 in March 2007, 1803 in March 2008, and 1835 in September
2008) calling for Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment and
reprocessing activities and comply with its IAEA obligations and
responsibilities. Resolutions 1737, 1477, and 1803 subject a number
of Iranian individuals and entities involved in Iran's nuclear and
ballistic missile programs to sanctions. Additionally, several
Iranian entities are subject to US sanctions under Executive Order
13382 designations for proliferation activities and EO 13224
designations for support of terrorism.

appointments to the more sensitive ministries
(For more information visit the World Leaders website )
note: also considered part of the Executive branch of government are
three oversight bodies: 1) Assembly of Experts (Majles-Khebregan), a
popularly elected body charged with determining the succession of
the Supreme Leader, reviewing his performance, and deposing him if
deemed necessary; 2) Expediency Council or the Council for the
Discernment of Expediency (Majma-e-Tashkhis-e-Maslahat-e-Nezam)
exerts supervisory authority over the executive, judicial, and
legislative branches and resolves legislative issues on which the
Majles and the Council of Guardians disagree and since 1989 has been
used to advise national religious leaders on matters of national
policy; in 2005 the Council's powers were expanded to act as a
supervisory body for the government; 3) Council of Guardians of the
Constitution or Council of Guardians or Guardians Council (Shora-ye

laws and establish judicial and legal policies; lower courts include
a special clerical court, a revolutionary court, and a special
administrative court



Political parties and leaders:


formal political parties are a relatively new phenomenon in Iran and
most conservatives still prefer to work through political pressure
groups rather than parties; often political parties or coalitions
are formed prior to elections and disbanded soon thereafter; a loose
pro-reform coalition called the 2nd Khordad Front, which includes
political parties as well as less formal groups and organizations,
achieved considerable success in elections for the sixth Majles in
early 2000; groups in the coalition included the Islamic Iran
Participation Front (IIPF), Executives of Construction Party
(Kargozaran), Solidarity Party, Islamic Labor Party, Mardom Salari,
Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization (MIRO), and
Militant Clerics Society (Ruhaniyun); the coalition participated in
the seventh Majles elections in early 2004; following his defeat in
the 2005 presidential elections, former MCS Secretary General and
sixth Majles Speaker Mehdi KARUBI formed the National Trust Party; a
new conservative group, Islamic Iran Developers Coalition
(Abadgaran), took a leading position in the new Majles after winning
a majority of the seats in February 2004; following the 2004 Majles
elections, traditional and hardline conservatives have attempted to
close ranks under the United Front of Principlists and the Broad
Popular Coalition of Principlists; several reformist groups, such as
the Mujahadin of the Islamic Revolution, came together as a
reformist coalition in advance of the 2008 Majles elections; the
IIPF has repeatedly complained that the overwhelming majority of its
candidates have been unfairly disqualified from the 2008 elections



Political pressure groups and leaders:


groups that generally support the Islamic Republic: Ansar-e
Hizballah-Islamic Coalition Party (Motalefeh); Followers of the Line
of the Imam and the Leader; Islamic Engineers Society; Tehran
Militant Clergy Association (Ruhaniyat); active pro-reform student
group: Office of Strengthening Unity (OSU); opposition groups:
Baluchistan People's Party (BPP); Freedom Movement of Iran; Green
Path movement [Mehdi KARUBI, Mir-Hosein MUSAVI]; Marz-e Por Gohar;
National Front; and various ethnic and Monarchist organizations;
armed political groups that have been repressed by the government:
Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI); Jundallah; Komala;
Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MEK or MKO); People's Fedayeen;
People's Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK)

Economy ::Iran




Economy - overview:


Iran's economy is marked by an inefficient state sector, reliance on
the oil sector, which provides the majority of government revenues,
and statist policies, which create major distortions throughout the
system. Private sector activity is typically limited to small-scale
workshops, farming, and services. Price controls, subsidies, and
other rigidities weigh down the economy, undermining the potential
for private-sector-led growth. Significant informal market activity
flourishes. The legislature in late 2009 passed President Mahmud
AHMADI-NEJAD's bill to reduce subsidies, particularly on food and
energy. The bill would phase out subsidies - which benefit Iran's
upper and middle classes the most - over three to five years and
replace them with cash payments to Iran's lower classes. However,
the start of the program was delayed repeatedly throughout 2010 over
fears of public reaction to higher prices. This is the most
extensive economic reform since the government implemented gasoline
rationing in 2007. The recovery of world oil prices in the last year
increased Iran's oil export revenue by at least $10 billion over
2009, easing some of the financial impact of the newest round of
international sanctions. Although inflation has fallen substantially
since the mid-2000s, Iran continues to suffer from double-digit
unemployment and underemployment. Underemployment among Iran's
educated youth has convinced many to seek jobs overseas, resulting
in a significant "brain drain."

exchange systems installed by Iran's state-owned telecom company
have improved and expanded the fixed-line network greatly;
fixed-line availability has more than doubled to nearly 26 million
lines since 2000; additionally, mobile-cellular service has
increased dramatically serving more than 50 million subscribers in
2009; combined fixed and mobile-cellular subscribership now exceeds
100 per 100 persons

Transnational Issues ::Iran




Disputes - international:


Iran protests Afghanistan's limiting flow of dammed tributaries to
the Helmand River in periods of drought; Iraq's lack of a maritime
boundary with Iran prompts jurisdiction disputes beyond the mouth of
the Shatt al Arab in the Persian Gulf; Iran and UAE dispute Tunb
Islands and Abu Musa Island, which are occupied by Iran; Iran stands
alone among littoral states in insisting upon a division of the
Caspian Sea into five equal sectors



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 914,268 (Afghanistan); 54,024 (Iraq)
(2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Iran is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude; Iranian women are
trafficked internally for the purpose of forced prostitution and for
forced marriages to settle debts; Iranian and Afghan children living
in Iran are trafficked internally for the purpose of forced
marriages, commercial sexual exploitation and involuntary servitude
as beggars or laborers to pay debts, provide income or support drug
addiction of their families; press reports indicate that criminal
organizations play a significant role in human trafficking to and
from Iran, in connection with smuggling of migrants, drugs, and arms

tier rating: Tier 3 - Iran did not provide evidence of law
enforcement activities against trafficking, and credible reports
indicate that Iranian authorities' response is not sufficient to
penalize offenders, protect victims, and eliminate trafficking; some
aspects of Iranian law and policy hinder efforts to combat
trafficking including punishment of victims and legal obstacles to
punishing offenders; Iran has not ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol
(2009)



Illicit drugs:


despite substantial interdiction efforts and considerable control
measures along the border with Afghanistan, Iran remains one of the
primary transshipment routes for Southwest Asian heroin to Europe;
suffers one of the highest opiate addiction rates in the world, and
has an increasing problem with synthetic drugs; lacks anti-money
laundering laws; has reached out to neighboring countries to share
counter-drug intelligence
