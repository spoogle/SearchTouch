Field Listing :: Population

  This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based
  on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics
  registration systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent
  past and on assumptions about future trends. The total population
  presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country
  on the world and within its region. Note: Starting with the 1993
  Factbook, demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African)
  have explicitly taken into account the effects of the growing impact
  of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These countries are currently: The
  Bahamas, Benin, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burma, Burundi,
  Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of
  the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Gabon,
  Ghana, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique,
  Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
  Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

  new Afghan census is scheduled to take place in 2010 (July 2010 est.)

  nearby islands south of 60 degrees south latitude (the region
  covered by the Antarctic Treaty); the population doing and
  supporting science or engaged in the management and protection of
  the Antarctic region varies from approximately 4,400 in summer to
  1,100 in winter; in addition, approximately 1,000 personnel,
  including ship's crew and scientists doing onboard research, are
  present in the waters of the treaty region; peak summer
