Ethiopia  (Africa)

Introduction ::Ethiopia




Background:


Unique among African countries, the ancient Ethiopian monarchy
maintained its freedom from colonial rule with the exception of a
short-lived Italian occupation from 1936-41. In 1974, a military
junta, the Derg, deposed Emperor Haile SELASSIE (who had ruled since
1930) and established a socialist state. Torn by bloody coups,
uprisings, wide-scale drought, and massive refugee problems, the
regime was finally toppled in 1991 by a coalition of rebel forces,
the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). A
constitution was adopted in 1994, and Ethiopia's first multiparty
elections were held in 1995. A border war with Eritrea late in the
1990s ended with a peace treaty in December 2000. In November 2007,
the Eritrea-Ethiopia Border Commission remotely demarcated the
border by geographical coordinates, but final demarcation of the
boundary on the ground is currently on hold because of Ethiopian
objections to an international commission's finding requiring it to
surrender territory considered sensitive to Ethiopia.

Valley; Erta Ale (elev. 613 m, 2,011 ft), which has caused frequent
lava flows in recent years, is the country's most active volcano;

(Lake Tana) in northwest Ethiopia; three major crops are believed to
have originated in Ethiopia: coffee, grain sorghum, and castor bean

note: Ethiopia is the oldest independent country in Africa, and the
three main colors of her flag (adopted ca. 1895) were so often
adopted by other African countries upon independence that they
became known as the Pan-African colors; the emblem in the center of
the current flag was added in 1996

Economy ::Ethiopia




Economy - overview:


Ethiopia's poverty-stricken economy is based on agriculture,
accounting for almost 45% of GDP, and 85% of total employment. The
agricultural sector suffers from frequent drought and poor
cultivation practices. Coffee is critical to the Ethiopian economy
with exports of some $350 million in 2006, but historically low
prices have seen many farmers switching to qat to supplement income.
Under Ethiopia's constitution, the state owns all land and provides
long-term leases to the tenants; the system continues to hamper
growth in the industrial sector as entrepreneurs are unable to use
land as collateral for loans. In November 2001, Ethiopia qualified
for debt relief from the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative, and in December 2005 the IMF forgave Ethiopia's debt.
The global economic downturn led to balance of payments pressures,
partially alleviated by recent emergency funding from the IMF. While
GDP growth has remained high, per capita inome is among the lowest
in the world.

Transnational Issues ::Ethiopia




Disputes - international:


Eritrea and Ethiopia agreed to abide by the 2002 Eritrea-Ethiopia
Boundary Commission's (EEBC) delimitation decision, but neither
party responded to the revised line detailed in the November 2006
EEBC Demarcation Statement; the undemarcated former British
administrative line has little meaning as a political separation to
rival clans within Ethiopia's Ogaden and southern Somalia's Oromo
region; Ethiopian forces invaded southern Somalia and routed
Islamist Courts from Mogadishu in January 2007; "Somaliland"
secessionists provide port facilities in Berbera and trade ties to
landlocked Ethiopia; civil unrest in eastern Sudan has hampered
efforts to demarcate the porous boundary with Ethiopia



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 66,980 (Sudan); 16,576 (Somalia);
13,078 (Eritrea)

IDPs: 200,000 (border war with Eritrea from 1998-2000, ethnic
clashes in Gambela, and ongoing Ethiopian military counterinsurgency
in Somali region; most IDPs are in Tigray and Gambela Provinces)
(2007)



Illicit drugs:


transit hub for heroin originating in Southwest and Southeast Asia
and destined for Europe, as well as cocaine destined for markets in
southern Africa; cultivates qat (khat) for local use and regional
export, principally to Djibouti and Somalia (legal in all three
countries); the lack of a well-developed financial system limits the
country's utility as a money laundering center
