Portugal  (Europe)

Introduction ::Portugal




Background:


Following its heyday as a global maritime power during the 15th and
16th centuries, Portugal lost much of its wealth and status with the
destruction of Lisbon in a 1755 earthquake, occupation during the
Napoleonic Wars, and the independence of its wealthiest colony of
Brazil in 1822. A 1910 revolution deposed the monarchy; for most of
the next six decades, repressive governments ran the country. In
1974, a left-wing military coup installed broad democratic reforms.
The following year, Portugal granted independence to all of its
African colonies. Portugal is a founding member of NATO and entered
the EC (now the EU) in 1986. In January 2011, Portugal assumed a
nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

Economy ::Portugal




Economy - overview:


Portugal has become a diversified and increasingly service-based
economy since joining the European Community in 1986. Over the past
two decades, successive governments have privatized many
state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy,
including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country
qualified for the European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1998 and began
circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU member
economies. Economic growth had been above the EU average for much of
the 1990s, but fell back in 2001-08, shrank 2.6% in 2009, before
growing 1% in 2010. GDP per capita stands at roughly two-thirds of
the EU-27 average. A poor educational system and a rigid labor
market have been obstacles to greater productivity and growth.
Portugal also has been increasingly overshadowed by lower-cost
producers in Central Europe and Asia as a target for foreign direct
investment. Portugal's competitiveness problems, low growth
prospects, and high levels of public debt have made it vulnerable to
bond market turbulence. Lisbon is implementing austerity measures to
reduce the budget deficit from 9.4% of GDP in 2009 to 4.6% of GDP in
2011, but some investors have expressed concern about Portugal's
ability to achieve these targets and cover its sovereign debt.
Without the option for stimulus measures, the government is focusing
instead on boosting exports and implementing labor market reforms to
try to raise GDP growth and tackle Portugal's competitiveness
problems, which may help mitigate investor concerns over time.
