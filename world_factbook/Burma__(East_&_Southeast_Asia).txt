Burma  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Burma




Background:


Britain conquered Burma over a period of 62 years (1824-1886) and
incorporated it into its Indian Empire. Burma was administered as a
province of India until 1937 when it became a separate,
self-governing colony; independence from the Commonwealth was
attained in 1948. Gen. NE WIN dominated the government from 1962 to
1988, first as military ruler, then as self-appointed president, and
later as political kingpin. In September 1988, the military deposed
NE WIN and established a new ruling junta. Despite multiparty
legislative elections in 1990 that resulted in the main opposition
party - the National League for Democracy (NLD) - winning a
landslide victory, the junta refused to hand over power. NLD leader
and Nobel Peace Prize recipient AUNG SAN SUU KYI, who was under
house arrest from 1989 to 1995 and 2000 to 2002, was imprisoned in
May 2003 and subsequently transferred to house arrest. She was
finally released in November 2010. After the ruling junta in August
2007 unexpectedly increased fuel prices, tens of thousands of
Burmese marched in protest, led by prodemocracy activists and
Buddhist monks. In late September 2007, the government brutally
suppressed the protests, killing at least 13 people and arresting
thousands for participating in the demonstrations. Since then, the
regime has continued to raid homes and monasteries and arrest
persons suspected of participating in the pro-democracy protests.
Burma in early May 2008 was struck by Cyclone Nargis which official
estimates claimed left over 80,000 dead and 50,000 injured. Despite
this tragedy, the junta proceeded with its May constitutional
referendum, the first vote in Burma since 1990. Parliamentary
elections held in November 2010, considered flawed by many in the
international community, saw the junta's Union Solidarity and
Development Party garnering over 70 percent of the seats. Parliament
is constitutionally mandated to convene within 90 days of the
election; the president, two vice presidents, and ministers will be
selected at that time.

Economy ::Burma




Economy - overview:


Burma, a resource-rich country, suffers from pervasive government
controls, inefficient economic policies, corruption, and rural
poverty. Despite Burma's emergence as a natural gas exporter,
socio-economic conditions have deteriorated under the regime's
mismanagement, leaving most of the public in poverty, while military
leaders and their business cronies exploit the country's ample
natural resources. The economy suffers from serious macroeconomic
imbalances - including rising inflation, fiscal deficits, multiple
official exchange rates that overvalue the Burmese kyat, a distorted
interest rate regime, unreliable statistics, and an inability to
reconcile national accounts to determine a realistic GDP figure.
Burma's poor investment climate hampers the inflow of foreign
investment; in recent years, foreign investors have shied away from
nearly every sector except for natural gas, power generation,
timber, and mining. The business climate is widely perceived as
opaque, corrupt, and highly inefficient. Over 60% of the FY 2009-10
budget is allocated to state owned enterprises - most operating at a
deficit. The government has recently privatized a number of state
owned enterprises, but most of the benefits have accrued to regime
insiders and cronies. The most productive sectors will continue to
be in extractive industries - especially oil and gas, mining, and
timber - with the latter two causing significant environmental
degradation. Other areas, such as manufacturing, tourism and
services, struggle in the face of inadequate infrastructure,
unpredictable trade policies, neglected health and education
systems, and endemic corruption. A major banking crisis in 2003
caused 20 private banks to close; private banks still operate under
tight restrictions, limiting the private sector's access to credit.
The United States, the European Union, Canada, and Australia have
imposed financial and economic sanctions on Burma, prohibiting most
financial transactions with Burmese entities, imposing travel bans
on Burmese officials and others connected to the ruling regime, and
banning imports of certain Burmese products. These sanctions
affected the country's fledgling garment industry, isolated the
struggling banking sector, and raised the costs of doing business
with Burmese companies, particularly firms tied to Burmese regime
leaders. The global crisis of 2008-09 caused exports and domestic
consumer demand to drop. Remittances from overseas Burmese workers -
who had provided significant financial support for their families -
slowed or dried up as jobs were lost and migrant workers returned
home. Though the Burmese government has good economic relations with
its neighbors, better investment and business climates and an
improved political situation are needed to promote serious foreign
investment, exports, and tourism.

Transnational Issues ::Burma




Disputes - international:


over half of Burma's population consists of diverse ethnic groups
who have substantial numbers of kin in neighboring countries;
Thailand must deal with Karen and other ethnic refugees, asylum
seekers, and rebels, as well as illegal cross-border activities from
Burma; Thailand is studying the feasibility of jointly constructing
the Hatgyi Dam on the Salween River near the border with Burma;
citing environmental, cultural, and social concerns, China is
reconsidering construction of 13 dams on the Salween River but
energy-starved Burma with backing from Thailand remains intent on
building five hydro-electric dams downstream, despite identical
regional and international protests; India seeks cooperation from
Burma to keep Indian Nagaland separatists, such as the United
Liberation Front of Assam, from hiding in remote Burmese Uplands;
after 21 years, Bangladesh in January 2008 resumed talks with Burma
on delimiting a maritime boundary



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 503,000 (government offensives against ethnic insurgent groups
near the eastern borders; most IDPs are ethnic Karen, Karenni, Shan,
Tavoyan, and Mon) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Burma is a source country for women, children,
and men trafficked for the purpose of forced labor and commercial
sexual exploitation; Burmese women and children are trafficked to
East and Southeast Asia for commercial sexual exploitation, domestic
servitude, and forced labor; Burmese children are subjected to
conditions of forced labor in Thailand as hawkers and beggars; women
are trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation to Malaysia and
China; some trafficking victims transit Burma from Bangladesh to
Malaysia and from China to Thailand; Burma's internal trafficking
remains the most serious concern occurring primarily from villages
to urban centers and economic hubs for labor in industrial zones,
agricultural estates, and commercial sexual exploitation; the
Burmese military continues to engage in the unlawful conscription of
child soldiers, and continues to be the main perpetrator of forced
labor inside Burma; ethnic insurgent groups also used compulsory
labor of adults and unlawful recruitment of children; the regime's
widespread use of and lack of accountability in forced labor and
recruitment of child soldiers is particularly worrying and
represents the top causal factor for Burma's significant trafficking
problem

tier rating: Tier 3 - serious problems remain in Burma, and in some
areas, most notably in the area of forced labor, the Government of
Burma is not making significant efforts to comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking, warranting a ranking
of Tier 3; in other areas, particularly with regard to international
sex trafficking of women and girls, the Government of Burma is
making significant efforts (2010)



Illicit drugs:


remains world's second largest producer of illicit opium with an
estimated production in 2008 of 340 metric tons, an increase of 26%,
and poppy cultivation in 2008 totaled 22,500 hectares, a 4% increase
from 2007; production in the United Wa State Army's areas of
greatest control remains low; Shan state is the source of 94% of
Burma's poppy cultivation; lack of government will to take on major
narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money
laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major
source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption (2008)
