Rwanda  (Africa)

Introduction ::Rwanda




Background:


In 1959, three years before independence from Belgium, the majority
ethnic group, the Hutus, overthrew the ruling Tutsi king. Over the
next several years, thousands of Tutsis were killed, and some
150,000 driven into exile in neighboring countries. The children of
these exiles later formed a rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF), and began a civil war in 1990. The war, along with several
political and economic upheavals, exacerbated ethnic tensions,
culminating in April 1994 in the genocide of roughly 800,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus. The Tutsi rebels defeated the Hutu regime and
ended the killing in July 1994, but approximately 2 million Hutu
refugees - many fearing Tutsi retribution - fled to neighboring
Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zaire. Since then, most of the
refugees have returned to Rwanda, but several thousand remained in
the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC; the former
Zaire) and formed an extremist insurgency bent on retaking Rwanda,
much as the RPF tried in 1990. Rwanda held its first local elections
in 1999 and its first post-genocide presidential and legislative
elections in 2003. Rwanda in 2009 staged a joint military operation
with the Congolese Army in DRC to rout out the Hutu extremist
insurgency there and Kigali and Kinshasa restored diplomatic
relations. Rwanda also joined the Commonwealth in late 2009.

Economy ::Rwanda




Economy - overview:


Rwanda is a poor rural country with about 90% of the population
engaged in (mainly subsistence) agriculture and some mineral and
agro-processing. In 2008, minerals overtook coffee and tea as
Rwanda's primary foreign exchange earner. The 1994 genocide
decimated Rwanda's fragile economic base, severely impoverished the
population, particularly women, and temporarily stalled the
country's ability to attract private and external investment.
However, Rwanda has made substantial progress in stabilizing and
rehabilitating its economy to pre-1994 levels. GDP has rebounded and
inflation has been curbed. Nonetheless, a majority still live below
the poverty line of 250 Rwandan francs per day (about US$0.43).
Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not
keep pace with demand, requiring food imports. Rwanda continues to
receive substantial aid money and obtained IMF-World Bank Heavily
Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative debt relief in 2005-06.
Rwanda also received a Millennium Challenge Account Compact in 2008.
Africa's most densely populated country is trying to overcome the
limitations of its small, landlocked economy by leveraging regional
trade. Rwanda joined the East African Community and is aligning its
budget, trade, and immigration policies with its regional partners.
The government has embraced an expansionary fiscal policy to reduce
poverty by improving education, infrastructure, and foreign and
domestic investment and pursuing market-oriented reforms, although
energy shortages, instability in neighboring states, and lack of
adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to
handicap growth. The global downturn hurt export demand and tourism,
but economic growth is recovering, driven in large part by the
services sector, and inflation has been contained. On the back of
this growth, government is gradually ending its fiscal stimulus
policy while protecting aid to the poor.

Telephone system:


general assessment: small, inadequate telephone system primarily
serves business, education, and government

domestic: the capital, Kigali, is connected to the centers of the
provinces by microwave radio relay and, recently, by cellular
telephone service; much of the network depends on wire and HF
radiotelephone; combined fixed-line and mobile-cellular telephone
density has increased to about 25 telephones per 100 persons

international: country code - 250; international connections employ
microwave radio relay to neighboring countries and satellite
communications to more distant countries; satellite earth stations -
1 Intelsat (Indian Ocean) in Kigali (includes telex and telefax
service)



Broadcast media:


government owns and operates the only TV station; government-owned
and operated Radio Rwanda has a national reach; 9 private radio
stations; transmissions of multiple international broadcasters are

Transnational Issues ::Rwanda




Disputes - international:


fighting among ethnic groups - loosely associated political rebels,
armed gangs, and various government forces in Great Lakes region
transcending the boundaries of Burundi, Democratic Republic of the
Congo, Rwanda, and Uganda - abated substantially from a decade ago
due largely to UN peacekeeping, international mediation, and efforts
by local governments to create civil societies; nonetheless, 57,000
Rwandan refugees still reside in 21 African states, including
Zambia, Gabon, and 20,000 who fled to Burundi in 2005 and 2006 to
escape drought and recriminations from traditional courts
investigating the 1994 massacres; the 2005 DROC and Rwanda border
verification mechanism to stem rebel actions on both sides of the
border remains in place



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 46,272 (Democratic Republic of the
Congo); 4,400 (Burundi) (2007)
