Djibouti  (Africa)

Introduction ::Djibouti




Background:


The French Territory of the Afars and the Issas became Djibouti in
1977. Hassan Gouled APTIDON installed an authoritarian one-party
state and proceeded to serve as president until 1999. Unrest among
the Afars minority during the 1990s led to a civil war that ended in
2001 following the conclusion of a peace accord between Afar rebels
and the Issa-dominated government. In 1999, Djibouti's first
multi-party presidential elections resulted in the election of
Ismail Omar GUELLEH; he was re-elected to a second term in 2005.
Djibouti occupies a strategic geographic location at the mouth of
the Red Sea and serves as an important transshipment location for
goods entering and leaving the east African highlands. The present
leadership favors close ties to France, which maintains a
significant military presence in the country but also has strong
ties with the US. Djibouti hosts the only US military base in
sub-Saharan Africa and is a front-line state in the global war on
terrorism.

Economy ::Djibouti




Economy - overview:


The economy is based on service activities connected with the
country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in the
Horn of Africa. Two-thirds of Djibouti's inhabitants live in the
capital city; the remainder are mostly nomadic herders. Scanty
rainfall limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most
food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit
port for the region and an international transshipment and refueling
center. Imports and exports from landlocked neighbor Ethiopia
represent 70% of port activity at Djibouti's container terminal.
Djibouti has few natural resources and little industry. The nation
is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help
support its balance of payments and to finance development projects.
An unemployment rate of nearly 60% in urban areas continues to be a
major problem. While inflation is not a concern, due to the fixed
tie of the Djiboutian franc to the US dollar, the artificially high
value of the Djiboutian franc adversely affects Djibouti's balance
of payments. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% between
1999 and 2006 because of recession, civil war, and a high population
growth rate (including immigrants and refugees). Djibouti has
experienced relatively minimal impact from the global economic
downturn, but its reliance on diesel-generated electricity and
imported food leave average consumers vulnerable to global price
shocks.
