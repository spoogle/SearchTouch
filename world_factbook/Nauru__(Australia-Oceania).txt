Nauru  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Nauru




Background:


The exact origins of the Nauruans are unclear since their language
does not resemble any other in the Pacific. The island was annexed
by Germany in 1888. Its phosphate deposits began to be mined early
in the 20th century by a German-British consortium. Nauru was
occupied by Australian forces in World War I and subsequently became
a League of Nations mandate. After the Second World War - and a
brutal occupation by Japan - Nauru became a UN trust territory. It
achieved independence in 1968 and joined the UN in 1999 as the
world's smallest independent republic.

Economy ::Nauru




Economy - overview:


Revenues of this tiny island have traditionally come from exports of
phosphates now significantly depleted. An Australian company in 2005
entered into an agreement intended to exploit remaining supplies.
Few other resources exist with most necessities being imported,
mainly from Australia its former occupier and later major source of
support. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of
income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. Reserves of
phosphates may only last until 2010 at current mining rates. In
anticipation of the exhaustion of Nauru's phosphate deposits,
substantial amounts of phosphate income were invested in trust funds
to help cushion the transition and provide for Nauru's economic
future. As a result of heavy spending from the trust funds, the
government faces virtual bankruptcy. To cut costs the government has
frozen wages and reduced overstaffed public service departments.
Nauru lost further revenue in 2008 with the closure of Australia's
refugee processing center, making it almost totally dependent on
food imports and foreign aid. Housing, hospitals, and other capital
plant is deteriorating. The cost to Australia of keeping the
government and economy afloat continues to climb. Few comprehensive
statistics on the Nauru economy exist with estimates of Nauru's GDP
varying widely.
