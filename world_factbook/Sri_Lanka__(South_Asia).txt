Sri Lanka  (South Asia)

Introduction ::Sri Lanka




Background:


The first Sinhalese arrived in Sri Lanka late in the 6th century
B.C. probably from northern India. Buddhism was introduced in about
the mid-third century B.C., and a great civilization developed at
the cities of Anuradhapura (kingdom from circa 200 B.C. to circa
A.D. 1000) and Polonnaruwa (from about 1070 to 1200). In the 14th
century, a south Indian dynasty established a Tamil kingdom in
northern Sri Lanka. The coastal areas of the island were controlled
by the Portuguese in the 16th century and by the Dutch in the 17th
century. The island was ceded to the British in 1796, became a crown
colony in 1802, and was united under British rule by 1815. As
Ceylon, it became independent in 1948; its name was changed to Sri
Lanka in 1972. Tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil
separatists erupted into war in 1983. After two decades of fighting,
the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
formalized a cease-fire in February 2002 with Norway brokering peace
negotiations. Violence between the LTTE and government forces
intensified in 2006 and the government regained control of the
Eastern Province in 2007. In May 2009, the government announced that
its military had finally defeated the remnants of the LTTE and that
its leader, Velupillai PRABHAKARAN, had been killed.

Economy ::Sri Lanka




Economy - overview:


Sri Lanka is engaging in large-scale reconstruction and development
projects following the end of the 26-year conflict with the LTTE,
including increasing electricity access and rebuilding its road and
rail network. Additionally, Sri Lanka seeks to reduce poverty by
using a combination of state directed policies and private
investment promotion to spur growth in disadvantaged areas, develop
small and medium enterprises, and promote increased agriculture,
High levels of government funding may be difficult, as the
government already is faced with high debt interest payments, a
bloated civil service, and historically high budget deficits. The
2008-09 global financial crisis and recession exposed Sri Lanka's
economic vulnerabilities and nearly caused a balance of payments
crisis, which was alleviated by a $2.6 billion IMF standby agreement
in July 2009. The end of the civil war and the IMF loan, however,
have largely restored investors' confidence, reflected in part by
the Sri Lankan stock market's recognition as one of the best
performing markets in the world. Sri Lankan growth rates averaged
nearly 5% in during the war, but increased government spending on
development and fighting the LTTE in the final years spurred GDP
growth to around 6-7% per year in 2006-08. After experiencing 3.5%
growth in 2009, Sri Lanka's economy is poised to achieve high growth
rates in the postwar period.

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Sri Lanka is a source and destination country for
men and women trafficked for the purposes of involuntary servitude
and commercial sexual exploitation; Sri Lankan men and women migrate
willingly to the Persian Gulf, Middle East, and East Asia to work as
construction workers, domestic servants, or garment factory workers,
where some find themselves in situations of involuntary servitude
when faced with restrictions on movement, withholding of passports,
threats, physical or sexual abuse, and debt bondage; children are
trafficked internally for commercial sexual exploitation and, less
frequently, for forced labor

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - for a fourth consecutive year, Sri
Lanka is on the Tier 2 Watch List for failing to provide evidence of
increasing efforts to combat severe forms of human trafficking,
particularly in the area of law enforcement; the government failed
to arrest, prosecute, or convict any person for trafficking offenses
and continued to punish some victims of trafficking for crimes
committed as a result of being trafficked; Sri Lanka has not
ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol (2008)
