Tuvalu  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Tuvalu




Background:


In 1974, ethnic differences within the British colony of the Gilbert
and Ellice Islands caused the Polynesians of the Ellice Islands to
vote for separation from the Micronesians of the Gilbert Islands.
The following year, the Ellice Islands became the separate British
colony of Tuvalu. Independence was granted in 1978. In 2000, Tuvalu
negotiated a contract leasing its Internet domain name ".tv" for $50
million in royalties over a 12-year period.







Geography ::Tuvalu




Location:


Oceania, island group consisting of nine coral atolls in the South
Pacific Ocean, about one-half of the way from Hawaii to Australia

Natural hazards:


severe tropical storms are usually rare, but in 1997 there were
three cyclones; low level of islands make them sensitive to changes
in sea level



Environment - current issues:


since there are no streams or rivers and groundwater is not potable,
most water needs must be met by catchment systems with storage
facilities (the Japanese Government has built one desalination plant
and plans to build one other); beachhead erosion because of the use
of sand for building materials; excessive clearance of forest
undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral reefs from the spread
of the Crown of Thorns starfish; Tuvalu is concerned about global
increases in greenhouse gas emissions and their effect on rising sea
levels, which threaten the country's underground water table; in
2000, the government appealed to Australia and New Zealand to take
in Tuvaluans if rising sea levels should make evacuation necessary



Environment - international agreements:


party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto
Protocol, Desertification, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection,
Ship Pollution, Whaling

Geography - note:


one of the smallest and most remote countries on Earth; six of the
nine coral atolls - Nanumea, Nui, Vaitupu, Nukufetau, Funafuti, and
Nukulaelae - have lagoons open to the ocean; Nanumaya and Niutao
have landlocked lagoons; Niulakita does not have a lagoon

Economy ::Tuvalu




Economy - overview:


Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of nine
coral atolls with poor soil. The country has no known mineral
resources and few exports and is almost entirely dependent upon
imported food and fuel. Subsistence farming and fishing are the
primary economic activities. Fewer than 1,000 tourists, on average,
visit Tuvalu annually. Job opportunities are scarce and public
sector workers make up most of those employed. About 15% of the
adult male population work as seamen on merchant ships abroad, and
remittances are a vital source of income contributing around $2
million in 2007. Substantial income is received annually from the
Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) an international trust fund established in
1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and
South Korea. Thanks to wise investments and conservative
withdrawals, this fund grew from an initial $17 million to an
estimated value of $77 million in 2006. The TTF contributed nearly
$9 million towards the government budget in 2006 and is an important
cushion for meeting shortfalls in the government's budget. The US
Government is also a major revenue source for Tuvalu because of
payments from a 1988 treaty on fisheries. In an effort to ensure
financial stability and sustainability, the government is pursuing
public sector reforms, including privatization of some government
functions and personnel cuts. Tuvalu also derives royalties from the
lease of its ".tv" Internet domain name with revenue of more than $2
million in 2006. A minor source of government revenue comes from the
sale of stamps and coins. With merchandise exports only a fraction
of merchandise imports, continued reliance must be placed on fishing
and telecommunications license fees, remittances from overseas
workers, official transfers, and income from overseas investments.
Growing income disparities and the vulnerability of the country to
climatic change are among leading concerns for the nation.
