Western Sahara  (Africa)

Introduction ::Western Sahara




Background:


Morocco annexed the northern two-thirds of Western Sahara (formerly
Spanish Sahara) in 1976 and claimed the rest of the territory in
1979, following Mauritania's withdrawal. A guerrilla war with the
Polisario Front contesting Morocco's sovereignty ended in a 1991
UN-brokered cease-fire; a UN-organized referendum on the territory's
final status has been repeatedly postponed. The UN since 2007 has
sponsored intermittent talks between representatives of the
Government of Morocco and the Polisario Front to negotiate the
status of Western Sahara. Morocco has put forward an autonomy
proposal for the territory, which would allow for some local
administration while maintaining Moroccan sovereignty. The
Polisario, with Algeria's support, demands a popular referendum that
includes the option of independence.

Government type:


legal status of territory and issue of sovereignty unresolved;
territory contested by Morocco and Polisario Front (Popular Front
for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro), which in

Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), near Tindouf, Algeria, led by
President Mohamed ABDELAZIZ; territory partitioned between Morocco
and Mauritania in April 1976 when Spain withdrew, with Morocco
acquiring northern two-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from
Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August
1979; Morocco moved to occupy that sector shortly thereafter and has
since asserted administrative control; the Polisario's
government-in-exile was seated as an Organization of African Unity
(OAU) member in 1984; Morocco between 1980 and 1987 built a
fortified sand berm delineating the roughly 80 percent of Western
Sahara west of the barrier that currently is controlled by Morocco;
guerrilla activities continued sporadically until a UN-monitored
cease-fire was implemented on 6 September 1991 (Security Council
Resolution 690) by the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara (MINURSO)

Economy ::Western Sahara




Economy - overview:


Western Sahara has a small market-based economy whose main indutries
are fishing, phosphate mining, and pastoral nomadism. The
territory's arid desert climate makes sedentary agriculture
difficult, and Wstern Sahara imports much of its food. The Moroccan
Government administers Western Sahara's economy and is a source of
employment, infrstructure development, and social spending in the
territory. Western Sahara's unresolved legal status makes the
exploitation of its natural resources a contentious issue between
Morocco and the Polisario. Morocco and the EU in July 2006 signed a
four-year agreement allowing European vessels to fish off the coast
of Morocco, including the disputed waters off the coast of Western
Sahara. Oil has never been found in Western Sahara in commercially
significant quantities, but Morocco and the Polisario have quarreled
over who has the right to authorize and benefit from oil exploration
in the territory. Western Sahara's main long-term economic challenge
is the development of a more diverse set of industries capable of
providing greater employment and income to the territory.

Morocco claims and administers Western Sahara, whose sovereignty

Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), but attempts to hold a
referendum have failed and parties thus far have rejected all
brokered proposals; several states have extended diplomatic
relations to the "Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic" represented by
the Polisario Front in exile in Algeria, while others recognize
Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara; most of the approximately
102,000 Sahrawi refugees are sheltered in camps in Tindouf, Algeria
