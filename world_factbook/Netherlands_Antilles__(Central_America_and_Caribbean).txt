Netherlands Antilles  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Netherlands Antilles




Background:


Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, the island of Curacao
was hard hit by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity
(and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th
century with the construction of oil refineries to service newly
discovered Venezuelan oil fields. The island of Saint Martin is
shared with France; its southern portion is named Sint Maarten and
is part of the Netherlands Antilles; its northern portion, called
Saint Martin, is an overseas collectivity of France.

Economy ::Netherlands Antilles




Economy - overview:


Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the mainstays
of this small economy, which is closely tied to the outside world.
Although GDP has declined or grown slightly in each of the past
eight years, the islands enjoy a high per capita income and a
well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the
region. The Venezuelan state oil company owns the single refinery on
the island; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from
Venezuela. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with
the US, Braxil, Italy, and Mexico being the major suppliers. Poor
soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the development of
agriculture. Budgetary problems hamper reform of the health and
pension systems of an aging population. The Netherlands provides
financial aid to support the economy.
