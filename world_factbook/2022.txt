Cuba
  illicit emigration is a continuing problem; Cubans attempt to
  depart the island and enter the US using homemade rafts, alien
  smugglers, direct flights, or falsified visas; Cubans also use
  non-maritime routes to enter the US including direct flights to
  Miami and over-land via the southwest border

Papua New Guinea
  the indigenous population of Papua New Guinea is
  one of the most heterogeneous in the world; PNG has several thousand
  separate communities, most with only a few hundred people; divided
  by language, customs, and tradition, some of these communities have
  engaged in low-scale tribal conflict with their neighbors for
  millennia; the advent of modern weapons and modern migrants into
  urban areas has greatly magnified the impact of this lawlessness

  estimated the population to be 1.3 million
