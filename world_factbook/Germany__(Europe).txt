Germany  (Europe)

Introduction ::Germany




Background:


As Europe's largest economy and second most populous nation (after
Russia), Germany is a key member of the continent's economic,
political, and defense organizations. European power struggles
immersed Germany in two devastating World Wars in the first half of
the 20th century and left the country occupied by the victorious
Allied powers of the US, UK, France, and the Soviet Union in 1945.
With the advent of the Cold War, two German states were formed in
1949: the western Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the eastern
German Democratic Republic (GDR). The democratic FRG embedded itself
in key Western economic and security organizations, the EC, which
became the EU, and NATO, while the Communist GDR was on the front
line of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. The decline of the USSR and the
end of the Cold War allowed for German unification in 1990. Since
then, Germany has expended considerable funds to bring Eastern
productivity and wages up to Western standards. In January 1999,
Germany and 10 other EU countries introduced a common European
exchange currency, the euro. In January 2011, Germany assumed a
nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

Flag description:


three equal horizontal bands of black (top), red, and gold; these

traced back to the medieval banner of the Holy Roman Emperor - a
black eagle with red claws and beak on a gold field



National anthem:


name: "Lied der Deutschen" (Song of the Germans)

lyrics/music: August Heinrich HOFFMANN VON FALLERSLEBE/Franz Joseph
HAYDN

note: adopted 1922, restored 1990; the anthem, also known as
"Deutschlandlied" (Song of Germany), was abolished in 1945 because
of the Nazi's use of the first verse, specifically the phrase,
"Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles" (Germany, Germany above all)
to promote nationalism; since restoration in 1990, only the third
verse is sung







Economy ::Germany




Economy - overview:


The German economy - the fifth largest economy in the world in PPP
terms and Europe's largest - is a leading exporter of machinery,
vehicles, chemicals, and household equipment and benefits from a
highly skilled labor force. Like its western European neighbors,
Germany faces significant demographic challenges to sustained
long-term growth. Low fertility rates and declining net immigration
are increasing pressure on the country's social welfare system and
necessitate structural reforms. The modernization and integration of
the eastern German economy - where unemployment can exceed 20% in
some municipalities - continues to be a costly long-term process,
with annual transfers from west to east amounting in 2008 alone to
roughly $12 billion. Reforms launched by the government of
Chancellor Gerhard SCHROEDER (1998-2005), deemed necessary to
address chronically high unemployment and low average growth,
contributed to strong growth in 2006 and 2007 and falling
unemployment, which in 2008 reached a new post-reunification low of
7.8%. These advances, as well as a government subsidized, reduced
working hour scheme, help explain the relatively modest increase in
unemployment during the 2008-09 recession - the deepest since World
War II - and its healthy decrease in 2010. GDP contracted nearly 5%
in 2009 but grew by 3.3% in 2010. Germany crept out of recession
thanks largely to rebounding manufacturing orders and exports -
primarily outside the Euro Zone - and relatively steady consumer
demand. Stimulus and stabilization efforts initiated in 2008 and
2009 and tax cuts introduced in Chancellor Angela MERKEL's second
term increased Germany's budget deficit to 3.3% in 2009 and to 3.6%
in 2010. The EU has given Germany until 2013 to get its consolidated
budget deficit below 3% of GDP. A new constitutional amendment
likewise limits the federal government to structural deficits of no
more than 0.35% of GDP per annum as of 2016.

western part

telephone exchanges connected by modern networks of fiber-optic
cable, coaxial cable, microwave radio relay, and a domestic
satellite system; cellular telephone service is widely available,

countries

international: country code - 49; Germany's international service is

facilities as well as earth stations in the Inmarsat, Intelsat,
