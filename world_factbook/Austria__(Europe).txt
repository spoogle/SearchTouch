Austria  (Europe)

Introduction ::Austria




Background:


Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire,
Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World
War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent
occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status
remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended
the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade
unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year
declared the country's "perpetual neutrality" as a condition for
Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and
Austria's entry into the European Union in 1995 have altered the
meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country,
Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

Flag description:


three equal horizontal bands of red (top), white, and red; the flag
design is certainly one of the oldest - if not the oldest - national
banners in the world; according to tradition, in 1191, following a
fierce battle in the Third Crusade, Duke Leopold V of Austria's
white tunic became completely blood-spattered; upon removal of his
wide belt or sash, a white band was revealed; the red-white-red
color combination was subsequently adopted as his banner



National anthem:


name: "Bundeshymne" (Federal Hymn)

lyrics/music: Paula von PRERADOVIC/Wolfgang Amadeus MOZART or Johann
HOLZER (disputed)

note: adopted 1947; the anthem is also known as "Land der Berge,
Land am Strome" (Land of the Mountains, Land on the River); Austria
adopted a new national anthem after World War II to replace the
former imperial anthem composed by Franz Josef HAYDN, which had been
appropriated by Germany in 1922 and was now associated with the Nazi
regime







Economy ::Austria




Economy - overview:


Austria, with its well-developed market economy and high standard of
living, is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's.
Its economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial
sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector.
Following several years of solid foreign demand for Austrian exports
and record employment growth, the international financial crisis and
global economic downturn in 2008 led to a recession that persisted
until the third quarter of 2009. Austrian GDP contracted 3.8% in
2009 but saw positive growth of about 2% in 2010. Unemployment has
not risen as steeply in Austria as elsewhere in Europe, partly
because its government has subsidized reduced working hour schemes
to allow companies to retain employees. Such stabilization measures,
stimulus initiatives, and the government's income tax reforms pushed
the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP in 2009 and about 5% in 2010, from
only about 1.3% in 2008. The international financial crisis caused
difficulties for some of Austria's largest banks whose extensive
operations in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe faced large
losses. The government provided bank support - including in some
instances, nationalization - to prevent insolvency and possible
regional contagion. In the medium-term all large Austrian banks will
need additional capital. Even after the global economic outlook
improves, Austria will need to continue restructuring, emphasizing
knowledge-based sectors of the economy, and encouraging greater
labor flexibility and greater labor participation to offset growing
unemployment and Austria's aging population and exceedingly low
fertility rate.
