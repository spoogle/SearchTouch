Taiwan  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Taiwan




Background:


In 1895, military defeat forced China to cede Taiwan to Japan.
Taiwan reverted to Chinese control after World War II. Following the
Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, 2 million Nationalists
fled to Taiwan and established a government using the 1947
constitution drawn up for all of China. Over the next five decades,
the ruling authorities gradually democratized and incorporated the
local population within the governing structure. In 2000, Taiwan
underwent its first peaceful transfer of power from the Nationalist
to the Democratic Progressive Party. Throughout this period, the
island prospered and became one of East Asia's economic "Tigers."
The dominant political issues continue to be the relationship
between Taiwan and China - specifically the question of Taiwan's
eventual status - as well as domestic political and economic reform.

Flag description:


red field with a dark blue rectangle in the upper hoist-side corner
bearing a white sun with 12 triangular rays; the blue and white
design of the canton (symbolizing the sun of progress) dates to
1895; it was later adopted as the flag of the Kuomintang Party; blue
signifies liberty, justice, and democracy; red stands for
fraternity, sacrifice, and nationaliam, white represents equality,
frankness, and the people's livelihood; the 12 rays of the sun are
those of the months and the twelve traditional Chinese hours (each
ray equals two hours)

note: somewhat resembles the flag of Burma

name: "Zhonghua Minguo guoge" (National Anthem of the Republic of
China)

Mao-Yun

note: adopted 1930; the anthem is also the song of the Kuomintang
Party; it is informally known as "San Min Cau I" (Three Principles
of the People); because of political pressure from China, "Guo qi
ee" (National Banner Song) is used at international events rather
than the official anthem of Taiwan; the "National Banner Song" has
gained popularity in Taiwan and is commonly used during flag raisings







Economy ::Taiwan




Economy - overview:


Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with gradually decreasing
government guidance of investment and foreign trade. In keeping with
this trend, some large, state-owned banks and industrial firms have
been privatized. Exports, led by electronics and machinery, generate
about 70% of Taiwan's GDP growth, and have provided the primary
impetus for economic development. This heavy dependence on exports
makes the economy vulnerable to downturns in world demand. In 2009,
Taiwan's GDP fell by 1.9%, due primarily to a 20% year-on-year
decline in exports. GDP grew more than 8% in 2010, as exports
returned to the level of previous years. Taiwan's diplomatic
isolation, low birth rate, and rapidly aging population are major
long-term challenges. Free trade agreements have proliferated in
East Asia over the past several years, but so far Taiwan has been
excluded from this greater economic integration, largely for reasons
of diplomacy. Taiwan's birth rate of only 1.2 child per woman is
among the lowest in the world, raising the prospect of future labor
shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues.
Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with the number of people over
65 accounting for 10.8% of the island's total population as of the
end of 2009. The island runs a large trade surplus, and its foreign
reserves are the world's fourth largest, behind China, Japan, and
Russia. Since President MA Ying-jeou took office in May 2008,
cross-Strait economic ties have increased significantly. Since 2005
China has overtaken the US to become Taiwan's second-largest source
of imports after Japan. China is also the island's number one
destination for foreign direct investment. Taipei has focused much
of its economic recovery effort on improving cross-Strait economic
integration. Three financial memorandums of understanding, covering
banking, securities, and insurance, took effect in mid-January 2010,
opening the island to greater investments from the Mainland's
financial firms and institutional investors, and providing new
opportunities for Taiwan financial firms to operate in China. Taiwan
and the mainland in June 2010 signed the landmark Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA), an agreement similar to a
free-trade agreement deal that will increase cross-Strait economic
ties by lowering tariffs on a number of goods. Taiwan's goverment
has said that the ECFA will serve as a stepping stone toward trade
pacts with other regional partners and announced the beginning of
negotiations on such an agreement with Singapore in August.

Disputes - international:

but falls short of a legally binding "code of conduct" desired by
several of the disputants; Paracel Islands are occupied by China,
but claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam; in 2003, China and Taiwan became
more vocal in rejecting both Japan's claims to the uninhabited
islands of the Senkaku-shoto (Diaoyu Tai) and Japan's unilaterally
declared exclusive economic zone in the East China Sea where all
parties engage in hydrocarbon prospecting



Illicit drugs:


regional transit point for heroin, methamphetamine, and precursor
