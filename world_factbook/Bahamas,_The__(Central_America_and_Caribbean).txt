Bahamas, The  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Bahamas, The




Background:


Lucayan Indians inhabited the islands when Christopher COLUMBUS
first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492. British
settlement of the islands began in 1647; the islands became a colony
in 1783. Since attaining independence from the UK in 1973, The
Bahamas has prospered through tourism and international banking and
investment management. Because of its geography, the country is a
major transshipment point for illegal drugs, particularly shipments
to the US and Europe, and its territory is used for smuggling
illegal migrants into the US.

Economy ::Bahamas, The




Economy - overview:


The Bahamas is one of the wealthiest Caribbean countries with an
economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism
together with tourism-driven construction and manufacturing accounts
for approximately 60% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs half
of the archipelago's labor force. Prior to 2006, a steady growth in
tourism receipts and a boom in construction of new hotels, resorts,
and residences led to solid GDP growth but since then tourism
receipts have begun to drop off. The global recession in 2009 took a
sizeable toll on the Bahamas, resulting in a contraction in GDP and
a widening budget deficit. The decline continued in 2010 as tourism
from the US and sector investment lagged. Financial services
constitute the second-most important sector of the Bahamian economy
and, when combined with business services, account for about 36% of
GDP. However, the financial sector currently is smaller than it has
been in the past because of the enactment of new and more strict
financial regulations in 2000 that caused many international
businesses to relocate elsewhere. Manufacturing and agriculture
combined contribute approximately a tenth of GDP and show little
growth, despite government incentives aimed at those sectors.
Overall growth prospects in the short run rest heavily on the
fortunes of the tourism sector.
