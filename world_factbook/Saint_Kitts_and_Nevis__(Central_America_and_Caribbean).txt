Saint Kitts and Nevis  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Saint Kitts and Nevis




Background:


Carib Indians occupied the islands for hundreds of years before the
British began settlement in 1623. The islands became an associated
state of the UK with full internal autonomy in 1967. The island of
Anguilla rebelled and was allowed to secede in 1971. Saint Kitts and
Nevis achieved independence in 1983. In 1998, a vote in Nevis on a
referendum to separate from Saint Kitts fell short of the two-thirds
majority needed. Nevis continues in its efforts to separate from
Saint Kitts.

Economy ::Saint Kitts and Nevis




Economy - overview:


The economy of Saint Kitts and Nevis is heavily dependent upon
tourism revenues, which has replaced sugar, the traditional mainstay
of the economy until the 1970s. Following the 2005 harvest, the
government closed the sugar industry after decades of losses of 3-4%
of GDP annually. To compensate for employment losses, the government
has embarked on a program to diversify the agricultural sector and
to stimulate other sectors of the economy, such as tourism,
export-oriented manufacturing, and offshore banking. More than
200,000 tourists visited the islands in 2009. Like other tourist
destinations in the Caribbean, St. Kitts and Nevis is vulnerable to
damage from natural disasters and shifts in tourism demand. The
current government is constrained by one of the world's highest
public debt burdens equivalent to roughly 185% of GDP, largely
attributable to public enterprise losses.
