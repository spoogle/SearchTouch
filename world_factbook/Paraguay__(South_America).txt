Paraguay  (South America)

Introduction ::Paraguay




Background:


Paraguay achieved its independence from Spain in 1811. In the
disastrous War of the Triple Alliance (1865-70) - between Paraguay
and Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay - Paraguay lost two-thirds of all
adult males and much of its territory. The country stagnated
economically for the next half century. Following the Chaco War of
1932-35 with Bolivia, Paraguay gained a large part of the Chaco
lowland region. The 35-year military dictatorship of Alfredo
STROESSNER ended in 1989, and, despite a marked increase in
political infighting in recent years, Paraguay has held relatively
free and regular presidential elections since then.

Economy ::Paraguay




Economy - overview:


Landlocked Paraguay has a market economy distinguished by a large
informal sector, featuring re-export of imported consumer goods to
neighboring countries, as well as the activities of thousands of
microenterprises and urban street vendors. A large percentage of the
population, especially in rural areas, derives its living from
agricultural activity, often on a subsistence basis. Because of the
importance of the informal sector, accurate economic measures are
difficult to obtain. On a per capita basis, real income has
stagnated at 1980 levels. The economy grew rapidly between 2003 and
2008 as growing world demand for commodities combined with high
prices and favorable weather to support Paraguay's commodity-based
export expansion. Paraguay is the sixth largest soy producer in the
world. Drought hit in 2008, reducing agricultural exports and
slowing the economy even before the onset of the global recession.
The economy fell 3.8% in 2009, as lower world demand and commodity
prices caused exports to contract. The government reacted by
introducing fiscal and monetary stimulus packages. Growth resumed at
a 6.5% level in 2010. Political uncertainty, corruption, limited
progress on structural reform, and deficient infrastructure are the
main obstacles to growth.
