Kyrgyzstan  (Central Asia)

Introduction ::Kyrgyzstan




Background:


A Central Asian country of incredible natural beauty and proud
nomadic traditions, most of Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to
Russia in 1876. The Kyrgyz staged a major revolt against the Tsarist
Empire in 1916 in which almost one-sixth of the Kyrgyz population
was killed. Kyrgyzstan became a Soviet republic in 1936 and achieved
independence in 1991 when the USSR dissolved. Nationwide
demonstrations in the spring of 2005 resulted in the ouster of
President Askar AKAEV, who had run the country since 1990.
Subsequent presidential elections in July 2005 were won
overwhelmingly by former prime minister Kurmanbek BAKIEV. Over the
next few years, the new president manipulated the parliament to
accrue new powers for himself. In July 2009, after months of
harassment against his opponents and media critics, BAKIEV won
re-election in a presidential campaign that the international
community deemed flawed. In April 2010, nationwide protests led to
the resignation and expulsion of BAKIEV. He was replaced by
President Roza OTUNBAEVA who will serve as president until 31
December 2011 according to a presidential decree issued 19 May 2010.
Presidential elections are scheduled to be held in October 2011.
Continuing concerns include: endemic corruption, poor interethnic
relations, and terrorism.

Economy ::Kyrgyzstan




Economy - overview:


Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with a dominant
agricultural sector. Cotton, tobacco, wool, and meat are the main
agricultural products, although only tobacco and cotton are exported
in any quantity. Industrial exports include gold, mercury, uranium,
natural gas, and electricity. The economy depends heavily on gold
exports - mainly from output at the Kumtor gold mine. Following
independence, Kyrgyzstan was progressive in carrying out market
reforms, such as an improved regulatory system and land reform.
Kyrgyzstan was the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
country to be accepted into the World Trade Organization. Much of
the government's stock in enterprises has been sold. Drops in
production had been severe after the breakup of the Soviet Union in
December 1991, but by mid-1995, production began to recover and
exports began to increase. In 2005, the BAKIEV government and
international financial institutions initiated a comprehensive
medium-term poverty reduction and economic growth strategy. Bishkek
agreed to pursue much needed tax reform and, in 2006, became
eligible for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative.
The government made steady strides in controlling its substantial
fiscal deficit, nearly closing the gap between revenues and
expenditures in 2006, before boosting expenditures more than 20% in
2007-08. GDP grew about 8% annually in 2007-08, partly due to higher
gold prices internationally, but slowed to 2.3% in 2009. The
overthrow of President BAKIEV in April, 2010 and subsequent ethnic
clashes left hundreds dead and damaged infrastructure. Shrinking
trade and agricultural production, as well as political instability,
caused GDP to contract about 3.5% in 2010. The fiscal deficit
widened to 12% of GDP, reflecting significant increases in
crisis-related spending, including both rehabilitation of damaged
infrastructure and bank recapitalization. Progress in
reconstruction, fighting corruption, restructuring domestic
industry, and attracting foreign aid and investment are key to
future growth.
