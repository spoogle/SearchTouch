Honduras  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Honduras




Background:


Once part of Spain's vast empire in the New World, Honduras became
an independent nation in 1821. After two and a half decades of
mostly military rule, a freely elected civilian government came to
power in 1982. During the 1980s, Honduras proved a haven for
anti-Sandinista contras fighting the Marxist Nicaraguan Government
and an ally to Salvadoran Government forces fighting leftist
guerrillas. The country was devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998,
which killed about 5,600 people and caused approximately $2 billion
in damage. Since then, the economy has slowly rebounded.

Economy ::Honduras




Economy - overview:


Honduras, the second poorest country in Central America, suffers
from extraordinarily unequal distribution of income, as well as high
underemployment. While historically dependent on the export of
bananas and coffee, Honduras has diversified its export base to
include apparel and automobile wire harnessing. Nearly half of
Honduras's economic activity is directly tied to the US, with
exports to the US equivalent to 30% of GDP and remittances for
another 20%. The US-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA)
came into force in 2006 and has helped foster foriegn direct
investment, but physical and political insecurity may deter
potential investors; about 70% of FDI is from US firms. The economy
registered marginally positive economic growth in 2010, insufficient
to improve living standards for the nearly 60% of the population in
poverty. The LOBO administration inherited a difficult fiscal
position with off-budget debts accrued in previous administrations
and government salaries nearly equivalent to tax collections. His
government has displayed a commitment to improving tax collection
and cutting expenditures. This enabled Tegucigalpa to secure an IMF
Precautionary Stand-By agreement in October 2010. The IMF agreement
has helped renew multilateral and bilateral donor confidence in
Honduras following the ZELAYA administration's economic
mismanagement and the political coup.

Telephone system:


general assessment: the number of fixed-line connections are
increasing but still limited; competition among multiple providers
of mobile-cellular services is contributing to a sharp increase in
the number of subscribers

domestic: beginning in 2003, private sub-operators allowed to
provide fixed-lines in order to expand telephone coverage
contributing to an increase in fixed-line teledensity to roughly 10
per 100 persons; mobile-cellular subscribership reached 100 per 100
persons in 2009

international: country code - 504; landing point for both the
Americas Region Caribbean Ring System (ARCOS-1) and the MAYA-1 fiber

satellite earth stations - 2 Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean); connected to
Central American Microwave System

Disputes - international:


International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled on the delimitation of
"bolsones" (disputed areas) along the El Salvador-Honduras border in
1992 with final settlement by the parties in 2006 after an
Organization of American States (OAS) survey and a further ICJ
ruling in 2003; the 1992 ICJ ruling advised a tripartite resolution
to a maritime boundary in the Gulf of Fonseca with consideration of
Honduran access to the Pacific; El Salvador continues to claim tiny
Conejo Island, not mentioned in the ICJ ruling, off Honduras in the
Gulf of Fonseca; Honduras claims the Belizean-administered Sapodilla
Cays off the coast of Belize in its constitution, but agreed to a
joint ecological park around the cays should Guatemala consent to a
maritime corridor in the Caribbean under the OAS-sponsored 2002
Belize-Guatemala Differendum; memorials and countermemorials were
filed by the parties in Nicaragua's 1999 and 2001 proceedings
against Honduras and Colombia at the ICJ over the maritime boundary
and territorial claims in the western Caribbean Sea - final public
hearings are scheduled for 2007
