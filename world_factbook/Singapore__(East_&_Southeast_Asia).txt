Economy ::Singapore




Economy - overview:


Singapore has a highly developed and successful free-market economy.
It enjoys a remarkably open and corruption-free environment, stable
prices, and a per capita GDP higher than that of most developed
countries. The economy depends heavily on exports, particularly in
consumer electronics, information technology products,
pharmaceuticals, and on a growing financial services sector. Real
GDP growth averaged 6.9% between 2004 and 2008. The economy
contracted 1.3% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis,
but rebounded nearly 15% in 2010, on the strength of renewed
exports. Over the longer term, the government hopes to establish a
new growth path that focuses on raising productivity growth, which
has sunk to 1% per year in the last decade. Singapore has attracted
major investments in pharmaceuticals and medical technology
production and will continue efforts to establish Singapore as
Southeast Asia's financial and high-tech hub.

Transnational Issues ::Singapore




Disputes - international:


disputes persist with Malaysia over deliveries of fresh water to
Singapore, Singapore's extensive land reclamation works, bridge
construction, and maritime boundaries in the Johor and Singapore
Straits; in 2008, ICJ awards sovereignty of Pedra Branca (Pulau Batu
Puteh/Horsburgh Island) to Singapore, and Middle Rocks to Malaysia,
but does not rule on maritime regimes, boundaries, or disposition of
South Ledge; Indonesia and Singapore continue to work on
finalization of their 1973 maritime boundary agreement by defining
unresolved areas north of Indonesia's Batam Island; piracy remains a
problem in the Malacca Strait



Illicit drugs:


drug abuse limited because of aggressive law enforcement efforts; as
a transportation and financial services hub, Singapore is
vulnerable, despite strict laws and enforcement, as a venue for
money laundering
