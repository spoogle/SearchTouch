New Caledonia  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::New Caledonia




Background:


Settled by both Britain and France during the first half of the 19th
century, the island was made a French possession in 1853. It served
as a penal colony for four decades after 1864. Agitation for
independence during the 1980s and early 1990s ended in the 1998
Noumea Accord, which over a period of 15 to 20 years will transfer
an increasing amount of governing responsibility from France to New
Caledonia. The agreement also commits France to conduct a referendum
between 2014 and 2019 to decide whether New Caledonia should assume
full sovereignty and independence.

Economy ::New Caledonia




Economy - overview:


New Caledonia has about 25% of the world's known nickel resources.
Only a small amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and
food accounts for about 20% of imports. In addition to nickel,
substantial financial support from France - equal to more than 15%
of GDP - and tourism are keys to the health of the economy.
Substantial new investment in the nickel industry, combined with the
recovery of global nickel prices, brightens the economic outlook for
the next several years.
