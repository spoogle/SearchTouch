Oman  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Oman




Background:


The inhabitants of the area of Oman have long prospered on Indian
Ocean trade. In the late 18th century, a newly established sultanate
in Muscat signed the first in a series of friendship treaties with
Britain. Over time, Oman's dependence on British political and
military advisors increased, but it never became a British colony.
In 1970, QABOOS bin Said Al-Said overthrew the restrictive rule of
his father; he has ruled as sultan ever since. His extensive
modernization program has opened the country to the outside world
while preserving the longstanding close ties with the UK. Oman's
moderate, independent foreign policy has sought to maintain good
relations with all Middle Eastern countries.

Economy ::Oman




Economy - overview:


Oman is a middle-income economy that is heavily dependent on
dwindling oil resources. Because of declining reserves, Muscat has
actively pursued a development plan that focuses on diversification,
industrialization, and privatization, with the objective of reducing
the oil sector's contribution to GDP to 9% by 2020. Tourism and
gas-based industries are key components of the government's
diversification strategy. By using enhanced oil recovery techniques,
Oman succeeded in increasing oil production, giving the country more
time to diversify, and the increase in global oil prices thoughout
2010 provides the government greater financial resources to invest
in non-oil sectors.
