Philippines  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Philippines




Background:


The Philippine Islands became a Spanish colony during the 16th
century; they were ceded to the US in 1898 following the
Spanish-American War. In 1935 the Philippines became a
self-governing commonwealth. Manuel QUEZON was elected president and
was tasked with preparing the country for independence after a
10-year transition. In 1942 the islands fell under Japanese
occupation during World War II, and US forces and Filipinos fought
together during 1944-45 to regain control. On 4 July 1946 the
Republic of the Philippines attained its independence. A 20-year
rule by Ferdinand MARCOS ended in 1986, when a "people power"
movement in Manila ("EDSA 1") forced him into exile and installed
Corazon AQUINO as president. Her presidency was hampered by several
coup attempts that prevented a return to full political stability
and economic development. Fidel RAMOS was elected president in 1992.
His administration was marked by increased stability and by progress
on economic reforms. In 1992, the US closed its last military bases
on the islands. Joseph ESTRADA was elected president in 1998. He was
succeeded by his vice-president, Gloria MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, in January
2001 after ESTRADA's stormy impeachment trial on corruption charges
broke down and another "people power" movement ("EDSA 2") demanded
his resignation. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO was elected to a six-year term as
president in May 2004. Her presidency was marred by several
corruption allegations but the Philippine economy was one of the few
to avoid contraction following the 2008 global financial crisis,
expanding each year of her administration. Benigno AQUINO III was
elected to a six-year term as president in May 2010. The Philippine
Government faces threats from several groups on the US Government's
Foreign Terrorist Organization list. Manila has waged a decades-long
struggle against ethnic Moro insurgencies in the southern
Philippines, which has led to a peace accord with the Moro National
Liberation Front and on-again/off-again peace talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front. The decades-long Maoist-inspired New
Peoples' Army insurgency also operates through much of the country.

Economy ::Philippines




Economy - overview:


Philippine GDP grew nearly 7% in 2010. The economy weathered the
2008-09 global recession better than its regional peers due to
minimal exposure to securities issued by troubled global financial
institutions; lower dependence on exports; relatively resilient
domestic consumption, supported by large remittances from four-to
five-million overseas Filipino workers; and a growing business
process outsourcing industry. Economic growth in the Philippines has
averaged 4.5% per year since 2001, when former President
MACAPAGAL-ARROYO took office. Despite this growth, poverty worsened
during the term of MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, because of a high population
growth rate and inequitable distribution of income. MACAPAGAL-ARROYO
averted a fiscal crisis by pushing for new revenue measures and,
until recently, tightening expenditures to address the government's
yawning budget deficit and to reduce high debt and debt service
ratios. But the government abandoned its 2008 balanced-budget goal
in order to help the economy weather the global financial and
economic storm. The economy under AQUINO faces budget shortfalls in
the near term, but has had little difficulty issuing debt both
locally and internationally to finance the deficits. AQUINO's first
budget emphasizes education and other social spending programs,
relying on the private sector to finance important infrastructure
projects. Weak tax collection in recent years limits the
government's ability to address major challenges.

"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea," has
eased tensions in the Spratly Islands but falls short of a legally
binding "code of conduct" desired by several of the disputants; in
March 2005, the national oil companies of China, the Philippines,
and Vietnam signed a joint accord to conduct marine seismic
activities in the Spratly Islands; Philippines retains a dormant
claim to Malaysia's Sabah State in northern Borneo based on the
Sultanate of Sulu's granting the Philippines Government power of
attorney to pursue a sovereignty claim on his behalf; maritime
delimitation negotiations continue with Palau
