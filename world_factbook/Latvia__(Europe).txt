Latvia  (Europe)

Introduction ::Latvia




Background:


The name "Latvia" originates from the ancient Latgalians, one of
four eastern Baltic tribes that formed the ethnic core of the
Latvian people (ca. 8th-12th centuries A.D.). The region
subsequently came under the control of Germans, Poles, Swedes, and
finally, Russians. A Latvian republic emerged following World War I,
but it was annexed by the USSR in 1940 - an action never recognized
by the US and many other countries. Latvia reestablished its
independence in 1991 following the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Although the last Russian troops left in 1994, the status of the
Russian minority (some 30% of the population) remains of concern to
Moscow. Latvia joined both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Economy ::Latvia




Economy - overview:


Latvia's economy experienced GDP growth of more than 10% per year
during 2006-07 but entered a severe recession in 2008 as a result of
an unsustainable current account deficit and large debt exposure
amid the softening world economy. GDP plunged 18% in 2009 - the
three former Soviet Baltic republics had the world's worst declines
that year - and another 1.8% in 2010. The IMF, EU, and other donors
provided assistance to Latvia as part of an agreement to defend the
currency's peg to the euro and reduce the fiscal deficit to about 5%
of GDP over time. DOMBROVSKIS' government enacted major speding cuts
to reduce the fiscal deficit to 7.8% of GDP in 2010, and plans to
cut the deficit further in 2011. The majority of companies, banks,
and real estate have been privatized, although the state still holds
sizable stakes in a few large enterprises. Latvia officially joined
the World Trade Organization in February 1999. EU membership, a top
foreign policy goal, came in May 2004.

Transnational Issues ::Latvia




Disputes - international:


Russia demands better Latvian treatment of ethnic Russians in
Latvia; as of January 2007, ground demarcation of the boundary with
Belarus was complete and mapped with final ratification
documentation in preparation; the Latvian parliament has not
ratified its 1998 maritime boundary treaty with Lithuania, primarily
due to concerns over oil exploration rights; as a member state that
forms part of the EU's external border, Latvia has implemented the
strict Schengen border rules with Russia



Illicit drugs:


transshipment and destination point for cocaine, synthetic drugs,
opiates, and cannabis from Southwest Asia, Western Europe, Latin
America, and neighboring Balkan countries; despite improved
legislation, vulnerable to money laundering due to nascent
enforcement capabilities and comparatively weak regulation of
offshore companies and the gaming industry; CIS organized crime
(including counterfeiting, corruption, extortion, stolen cars, and
prostitution) accounts for most laundered proceeds
