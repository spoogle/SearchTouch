Finland  (Europe)

Introduction ::Finland




Background:


Finland was a province and then a grand duchy under Sweden from the
12th to the 19th centuries, and an autonomous grand duchy of Russia
after 1809. It won its complete independence in 1917. During World
War II, it was able to successfully defend its freedom and resist
invasions by the Soviet Union - albeit with some loss of territory.
In the subsequent half century, the Finns made a remarkable
transformation from a farm/forest economy to a diversified modern
industrial economy; per capita income is now among the highest in
Western Europe. A member of the European Union since 1995, Finland
was the only Nordic state to join the euro system at its initiation
in January 1999. In the 21st century, the key features of Finland's
modern welfare state are a high standard of education, equality
promotion, and national social security system; currently challenged
by an aging population and the fluctuations of an export-driven
economy.

Economy ::Finland




Economy - overview:


Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free-market economy
with per capita output roughly that of Austria, Belgium, the
Netherlands, and Sweden. Trade is important with exports accounting
for over one third of GDP in recent years. Finland is strongly
competitive in manufacturing - principally the wood, metals,
engineering, telecommunications, and electronics industries. Finland
excels in high-tech exports such as mobile phones. Except for timber
and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw materials,
energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of the
climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export
earner, provides a secondary occupation for the rural population.
Finland had been one of the best performing economies within the EU
in recent years and its banks and financial markets avoided the
worst of global financial crisis. However, the world slowdown hit
exports and domestic demand hard in 2009, with Finland experiencing
one of the deepest contractions in the euro zone. A recovery of
exports stimulated economic growth in 2010, and led to a lowering of
unemployment. The recession left a deep mark on general government
finances and the debt ratio, turning previously strong budget
surpluses into deficits. In the next few years, the great challenge
of economic policy will be to implement a post-recession exit
strategy in which measures supporting growth will be combined with
general government adjustment measures. Longer-term, Finland must
address a rapidly aging population and decreasing productivity that
threaten competitiveness, fiscal sustainability, and economic growth.
