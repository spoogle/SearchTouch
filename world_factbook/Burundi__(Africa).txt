Introduction ::Burundi




Background:


Burundi's first democratically elected president was assassinated in
October 1993 after only 100 days in office, triggering widespread
ethnic violence between Hutu and Tutsi factions. More than 200,000
Burundians perished during the conflict that spanned almost a dozen
years. Hundreds of thousands of Burundians were internally displaced
or became refugees in neighboring countries. An internationally
brokered power-sharing agreement between the Tutsi-dominated
government and the Hutu rebels in 2003 paved the way for a
transition process that led to an integrated defense force,
established a new constitution in 2005, and elected a majority Hutu
government in 2005. The new government, led by President Pierre
NKURUNZIZA, signed a South African brokered ceasefire with the
country's last rebel group in September of 2006 but still faces many
challenges.

Economy ::Burundi




Economy - overview:


Burundi is a landlocked, resource-poor country with an
underdeveloped manufacturing sector. The economy is predominantly
agricultural which accounts for about 35% of GDP and employs more
than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and
tea, which account for 90% of foreign exchange earnings, though
exports are a relatively small share of GDP. Burundi's export
earning - and its ability to pay for imports - rests primarily on
weather conditions and international coffee and tea prices. The
Tutsi minority, 14% of the population, dominates the coffee trade.
An ethnic-based war that lasted for over a decade resulted in more
than 200,000 deaths, forced more than 48,000 refugees into Tanzania,
and displaced 140,000 others internally. Only one in two children go
to school, and approximately one in 15 adults has HIV/AIDS. Food,
medicine, and electricity remain in short supply. Burundi's GDP grew
around 4% annually in 2006-09. Political stability and the end of
the civil war have improved aid flows and economic activity has
increased, but underlying weaknesses - a high poverty rate, poor
education rates, a weak legal system, and low administrative
capacity - risk undermining planned economic reforms. Burundi will
continue to remain heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and
multilateral donors; the delay of funds after a corruption scandal
cut off bilateral aid in 2007 reduced government's revenues and its
ability to pay salaries. Burundi joined the East African Community,
which should boost Burundi's regional trade ties, and received $700
million in debt relief in 2009. Instability spilling over from
eastern Congo-Kinshasa and the ban on minerals smuggled across
Burundi's border will be the main challenges to economic growth.
