Field Listing :: Government type

  This entry gives the basic form of government. Definitions of the
  major governmental terms are as follows. (Note that for some
  countries more than one definition applies.):
  Absolute monarchy - a form of government where the monarch rules
  unhindered, i.e., without any laws, constitution, or legally
  organized opposition.
  Anarchy - a condition of lawlessness or political disorder brought
  about by the absence of governmental authority.
  Authoritarian - a form of government in which state authority is
  imposed onto many aspects of citizens' lives.
  Commonwealth - a nation, state, or other political entity founded on
  law and united by a compact of the people for the common good.
  Communist - a system of government in which the state plans and
  controls the economy and a single - often authoritarian - party
  holds power; state controls are imposed with the elimination of
  private ownership of property or capital while claiming to make
  progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally
  shared by the people (i.e., a classless society).
  Confederacy (Confederation) - a union by compact or treaty between
  states, provinces, or territories, that creates a central government
  with limited powers; the constituent entities retain supreme
  authority over all matters except those delegated to the central
  government.
  Constitutional - a government by or operating under an authoritative
  document (constitution) that sets forth the system of fundamental
  laws and principles that determines the nature, functions, and
  limits of that government.
  Constitutional democracy - a form of government in which the
  sovereign power of the people is spelled out in a governing
  constitution.
  Constitutional monarchy - a system of government in which a monarch
  is guided by a constitution whereby his/her rights, duties, and
  responsibilities are spelled out in written law or by custom.
  Democracy - a form of government in which the supreme power is
  retained by the people, but which is usually exercised indirectly
  through a system of representation and delegated authority
  periodically renewed.
  Democratic republic - a state in which the supreme power rests in
  the body of citizens entitled to vote for officers and
  representatives responsible to them.
  Dictatorship - a form of government in which a ruler or small clique
  wield absolute power (not restricted by a constitution or laws).
  Ecclesiastical - a government administrated by a church.
  Emirate - similar to a monarchy or sultanate, but a government in
  which the supreme power is in the hands of an emir (the ruler of a
  Muslim state); the emir may be an absolute overlord or a sovereign
  with constitutionally limited authority.
  Federal (Federation) - a form of government in which sovereign power
  is formally divided - usually by means of a constitution - between a
  central authority and a number of constituent regions (states,
  colonies, or provinces) so that each region retains some management
  of its internal affairs; differs from a confederacy in that the
  central government exerts influence directly upon both individuals
  as well as upon the regional units.
  Federal republic - a state in which the powers of the central
  government are restricted and in which the component parts (states,
  colonies, or provinces) retain a degree of self-government; ultimate
  sovereign power rests with the voters who chose their governmental
  representatives.
  Islamic republic - a particular form of government adopted by some
  Muslim states; although such a state is, in theory, a theocracy, it
  remains a republic, but its laws are required to be compatible with
  the laws of Islam.
  Maoism - the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism developed in
  China by Mao Zedong (Mao Tse-tung), which states that a continuous
  revolution is necessary if the leaders of a communist state are to
  keep in touch with the people.
  Marxism - the political, economic, and social principles espoused by
  19th century economist Karl Marx; he viewed the struggle of workers
  as a progression of historical forces that would proceed from a
  class struggle of the proletariat (workers) exploited by capitalists
  (business owners), to a socialist "dictatorship of the proletariat,"
  to, finally, a classless society - Communism.
  Marxism-Leninism - an expanded form of communism developed by Lenin
  from doctrines of Karl Marx; Lenin saw imperialism as the final
  stage of capitalism and shifted the focus of workers' struggle from
  developed to underdeveloped countries.
  Monarchy - a government in which the supreme power is lodged in the
  hands of a monarch who reigns over a state or territory, usually for
  life and by hereditary right; the monarch may be either a sole
  absolute ruler or a sovereign - such as a king, queen, or prince -
  with constitutionally limited authority.
  Oligarchy - a government in which control is exercised by a small
  group of individuals whose authority generally is based on wealth or
  power.
  Parliamentary democracy - a political system in which the
  legislature (parliament) selects the government - a prime minister,
  premier, or chancellor along with the cabinet ministers - according
  to party strength as expressed in elections; by this system, the
  government acquires a dual responsibility: to the people as well as
  to the parliament.
  Parliamentary government (Cabinet-Parliamentary government) - a
  government in which members of an executive branch (the cabinet and
  its leader - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor) are nominated
  to their positions by a legislature or parliament, and are directly
  responsible to it; this type of government can be dissolved at will
  by the parliament (legislature) by means of a no confidence vote or
  the leader of the cabinet may dissolve the parliament if it can no
  longer function.
  Parliamentary monarchy - a state headed by a monarch who is not
  actively involved in policy formation or implementation (i.e., the
  exercise of sovereign powers by a monarch in a ceremonial capacity);
  true governmental leadership is carried out by a cabinet and its
  head - a prime minister, premier, or chancellor - who are drawn from
  a legislature (parliament).
  Presidential - a system of government where the executive branch
  exists separately from a legislature (to which it is generally not
  accountable).
  Republic - a representative democracy in which the people's elected
  deputies (representatives), not the people themselves, vote on
  legislation.
  Socialism - a government in which the means of planning, producing,
  and distributing goods is controlled by a central government that
  theoretically seeks a more just and equitable distribution of
  property and labor; in actuality, most socialist governments have
  ended up being no more than dictatorships over workers by a ruling
  elite.
  Sultanate - similar to a monarchy, but a government in which the
  supreme power is in the hands of a sultan (the head of a Muslim
  state); the sultan may be an absolute ruler or a sovereign with
  constitutionally limited authority.
  Theocracy - a form of government in which a Deity is recognized as
  the supreme civil ruler, but the Deity's laws are interpreted by
  ecclesiastical authorities (bishops, mullahs, etc.); a government
  subject to religious authority.
  Totalitarian - a government that seeks to subordinate the individual
  to the state by controlling not only all political and economic
  matters, but also the attitudes, values, and beliefs of its
  population.

  legal status of territory and issue of sovereignty
  unresolved; territory contested by Morocco and Polisario Front
  (Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de
  Oro), which in February 1976 formally proclaimed a
  government-in-exile, the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR),
  near Tindouf, Algeria, led by President Mohamed ABDELAZIZ; territory
  partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976 when Spain
  withdrew, with Morocco acquiring northern two-thirds; Mauritania,
  under pressure from Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to
  its portion in August 1979; Morocco moved to occupy that sector
  shortly thereafter and has since asserted administrative control;
  the Polisario's government-in-exile was seated as an Organization of
