Kuwait  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Kuwait




Background:


Britain oversaw foreign relations and defense for the ruling Kuwaiti
AL-SABAH dynasty from 1899 until independence in 1961. Kuwait was
attacked and overrun by Iraq on 2 August 1990. Following several
weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led, UN coalition began a ground
assault on 23 February 1991 that liberated Kuwait in four days.
Kuwait spent more than $5 billion to repair oil infrastructure
damaged during 1990-91. The AL-SABAH family has ruled since
returning to power in 1991 and reestablished an elected legislature
that in recent years has become increasingly assertive. The country
witnessed the historic election in May 2009 of four women to its
National Assembly.

Economy ::Kuwait




Economy - overview:


Kuwait has a geographically small, but wealthy, relatively open
economy with self-reported crude oil reserves of about 102 billion
barrels - about 9% of world reserves. Petroleum accounts for nearly
half of GDP, 95% of export revenues, and 95% of government income.
Kuwaiti officials have committed to increasing oil production to 4
million barrels per day by 2020. The rise in global oil prices
throughout 2010 is reviving government consumption and economic
growth as Kuwait experiences a 20% increase in government budget
revenue. Kuwait has done little to diversify its economy, in part,
because of this positive fiscal situation, and, in part, due to the
poor business climate and the acrimonious relationship between the
National Assembly and the executive branch, which has stymied most
movement on economic reforms. Nonetheless, the government in May
2010 passed a privatization bill that allows the government to sell
assets to private investors, and in January passed an economic
development plan that pledges to spend up to $130 billion in five
years to diversify the economy away from oil, attract more
investment, and boost private sector participation in the economy.
Increasing government expenditures by so large an amount during the
planned time frame may be difficult to accomplish.

Transnational Issues ::Kuwait




Disputes - international:


Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continue negotiating a joint maritime
boundary with Iran; no maritime boundary exists with Iraq in the
Persian Gulf



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Kuwait is a destination country for men and women
who migrate legally from South and Southeast Asia for domestic or
low-skilled labor, but are subjected to conditions of involuntary
servitude by employers in Kuwait including conditions of physical
and sexual abuse, non-payment of wages, confinement to the home, and
withholding of passports to restrict their freedom of movement;
Kuwait is reportedly a transit point for South and East Asian
workers recruited for low-skilled work in Iraq; some of these
workers are deceived as to the true location and nature of this
work, and others are subjected to conditions of involuntary
servitude in Iraq

tier rating: Tier 3 - Kuwaiti government has shown an inability to
define trafficking and has demonstrated insufficient political will
to address human trafficking adequately; much of the human
trafficking found in Kuwait involves domestic workers in private
residences and the government is reluctant to prosecute Kuwaiti
citizens; the government has not enacted legislation targeting human
trafficking nor established a permanent shelter for victims of
trafficking (2009)
