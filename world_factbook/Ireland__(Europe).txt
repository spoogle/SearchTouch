Ireland  (Europe)

Introduction ::Ireland




Background:


Celtic tribes arrived on the island between 600-150 B.C. Invasions
by Norsemen that began in the late 8th century were finally ended
when King Brian BORU defeated the Danes in 1014. English invasions
began in the 12th century and set off more than seven centuries of
Anglo-Irish struggle marked by fierce rebellions and harsh
repressions. A failed 1916 Easter Monday Rebellion touched off
several years of guerrilla warfare that in 1921 resulted in
independence from the UK for 26 southern counties; six northern
(Ulster) counties remained part of the UK. In 1949, Ireland withdrew
from the British Commonwealth; it joined the European Community in
1973. Irish governments have sought the peaceful unification of
Ireland and have cooperated with Britain against terrorist groups. A
peace settlement for Northern Ireland is gradually being implemented
despite some difficulties. In 2006, the Irish and British
governments developed and began to implement the St. Andrews
Agreement, building on the Good Friday Agreement approved in 1998.

Flag description:


three equal vertical bands of green (hoist side), white, and orange;
officially the flag colors have no meaning, but a common
interpretation is that the green represents the Irish nationalist
(Gaelic) tradition of Ireland; orange represents the Orange
tradition (minority supporters of William of Orange); white
symbolizes peace (or a lasting truce) between the green and the
orange

note: similar to the flag of Cote d'Ivoire, which is shorter and has
the colors reversed - orange (hoist side), white, and green; also
similar to the flag of Italy, which is shorter and has colors of
green (hoist side), white, and red



National anthem:


name: "Amhran na bhFiann" (The Soldier"s Song)

lyrics/music: Peadar KEARNEY [English], Liam O RINN [Irish]/Patrick
HEENEY and Peadar KEARNEY

note: adopted 1926; instead of "Amhran na bhFiann," the song
"Ireland"s Call" is often used in athletic events where citizens of
the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland compete as a unified
team







Economy ::Ireland




Economy - overview:


Ireland is a small, modern, trade-dependent economy. Ireland joined
11 other EU nations in circulating the euro on 1 January 2002. GDP
growth averaged 6% in 1995-2007, but economic activity has dropped
sharply since 2008 with GDP falling by over 3% in 2008, nearly 8% in
2009, and 1% in 2010, and further contraction is expectd in 2011.
Ireland entered into a recession for the first time in more than a
decade with the onset of the world financial crisis and subsequent
severe slowdown in its domestic property and construction markets.
Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by
industry and services. Although the export sector, dominated by
foreign multinationals, remains a key component of Ireland's
economy, construction most recently fueled economic growth along
with strong consumer spending and business investment. Property
prices rose more rapidly in Ireland in the decade up to 2007 than in
any other developed economy. However, average home prices have
fallen 50% from the 2007 peak. In 2008 the COWEN government moved to
guarantee all bank deposits, recapitalize the banking system, and
establish partly-public venture capital funds in response to the
country's economic downturn. In 2009, in an effort to stabilize the
banking sector, the Irish Government established the National Asset
Management Agency (NAMA) to acquire problem commercial property and
development loans from Irish banks. Faced with sharply reduced
revenues and a burgeoning budget deficit, the Irish Government
introduced the first in a series of draconian budgets in 2009. In
addition to across-the-board cuts in spending, the 2009 budget
included wage reductions for all public servants. These measures
were not sufficient. The budget deficit reached nearly 38% of GDP in
2010 because of additional government support for the banking
sector. In late 2010, the COWEN Government agreed to a $112 billion
loan package from the EU and IMF to help Dublin recapitalize its
banking sector and avoid defaulting on its sovereign debt, and
initiated a four-year austerity plan to cut an additional $20
billion from its budget.
