Mozambique  (Africa)

Introduction ::Mozambique




Background:


Almost five centuries as a Portuguese colony came to a close with
independence in 1975. Large-scale emigration, economic dependence on
South Africa, a severe drought, and a prolonged civil war hindered
the country's development until the mid 1990's. The ruling Front for
the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO) party formally abandoned
Marxism in 1989, and a new constitution the following year provided
for multiparty elections and a free market economy. A UN-negotiated
peace agreement between FRELIMO and rebel Mozambique National
Resistance (RENAMO) forces ended the fighting in 1992. In December
2004, Mozambique underwent a delicate transition as Joaquim CHISSANO
stepped down after 18 years in office. His elected successor,
Armando Emilio GUEBUZA, promised to continue the sound economic
policies that have encouraged foreign investment.

Economy ::Mozambique




Economy - overview:


At independence in 1975, Mozambique was one of the world's poorest
countries. Socialist mismanagement and a brutal civil war from
1977-92 exacerbated the situation. In 1987, the government embarked
on a series of macroeconomic reforms designed to stabilize the
economy. These steps, combined with donor assistance and with
political stability since the multi-party elections in 1994, have
led to dramatic improvements in the country's growth rate. Fiscal
reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and reform
of the customs service, have improved the government's revenue
collection abilities. In spite of these gains, Mozambique remains
dependent upon foreign assistance for more than half of its annual
budget, and the majority of the population remains below the poverty
line. Subsistence agriculture continues to employ the vast majority
of the country's work force and smallholder agricultural
productivity and productivity growth is weak. A substantial trade
imbalance persists although the opening of the Mozal aluminum
smelter, the country's largest foreign investment project to date,
has increased export earnings. At the end of 2007, and after years
of negotiations, the government took over Portugal's majority share
of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectricity (HCB) company, a dam that was
not transferred to Mozambique at independence because of the ensuing
civil war and unpaid debts. More power is needed for additional
investment projects in titanium extraction and processing and
garment manufacturing that could further close the import/export
gap. Mozambique's once substantial foreign debt has been reduced
through forgiveness and rescheduling under the IMF's Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) and Enhanced HIPC initiatives, and is
now at a manageable level. In July 2007 the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) signed a Compact with Mozambique; the Compact
entered into force in September 2008 and will continue for five
years. Compact projects will focus on improving sanitation, roads,
agriculture, and the business regulation environment in an effort to
spur economic growth in the four northern provinces of the country.
Mozambique grew at an average annual rate of 9% in the decade up to
2007, one of Africa's strongest performances. However, heavy
reliance on aluminum, which accounts for about one-third of exports,
subjects the economy to volatile international prices. The sharp
decline in aluminum prices during the global economic crisis lowered
GDP growth by several percentage points. Despite 8.3% GDP growth in
2010, the increasing cost of living prompted citizens to riot in
September 2010, after bread price increases were announced. In an
attempt to contain the cost of living, the government implemented
subsidies, decreased taxes and tariffs, and instituted other fiscal
measures.

Telephone system:


general assessment: a fair telecommunications system that is
shackled with a heavy state presence, lack of competition, and high
operating costs and charges

domestic: stagnation in the fixed-line network contrasts with rapid
growth in the mobile-cellular network; mobile-cellular coverage now
includes all the main cities and key roads, including those from
Maputo to the South African and Swaziland borders, the national
highway through Gaza and Inhambane provinces, the Beira corridor,
and from Nampula to Nacala; extremely low fixed-line teledensity;
despite significant growth in mobile-cellular services, teledensity
remains low at about 25 per 100 persons

international: country code - 258; satellite earth stations - 5
Intelsat (2 Atlantic Ocean and 3 Indian Ocean); landing point for
the SEACOM fiber-optic cable



Broadcast media:


1 state-run TV station supplemented by private TV station;
Portuguese state TV's African service, RTP Africa, and
Brazilian-owned TV Miramar are available; state-run radio provides
nearly 100% territorial coverage and broadcasts in multiple
languages; a number of privately-owned and community-operated
stations also broadcast; transmissions of multiple international
broadcasters are available (2007)

laundering, but the lack of a well-developed financial
infrastructure limits the country's utility as a money-laundering
center
