Swaziland  (Africa)

Introduction ::Swaziland




Background:


Autonomy for the Swazis of southern Africa was guaranteed by the
British in the late 19th century; independence was granted in 1968.
Student and labor unrest during the 1990s pressured King MSWATI III,
the world's last absolute monarch, to grudgingly allow political
reform and greater democracy, although he has backslid on these
promises in recent years. A constitution came into effect in 2006,
but political parties remain banned. The African United Democratic
Party tried unsuccessfully to register as an official political
party in mid 2006. Talks over the constitution broke down between
the government and progressive groups in 2007. Swaziland recently
surpassed Botswana as the country with the world's highest known
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate.

Economy ::Swaziland




Economy - overview:


In this small, landlocked economy, subsistence agriculture occupies
approximately 70% of the population. The manufacturing sector has
diversified since the mid-1980s. Sugar and wood pulp remain
important foreign exchange earners. In 2007, the sugar industry
increased efficiency and diversification efforts, in response to a
17% decline in EU sugar prices. Mining has declined in importance in
recent years with only coal and quarry stone mines remaining active.
Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from
which it receives more than nine-tenths of its imports and to which
it sends 60% of its exports. Swaziland's currency is pegged to the
South African rand, subsuming Swaziland's monetary policy to South
Africa. Customs duties from the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) account for two-thirds of Swaziland's government revenues,
and worker remittances from South Africa substantially supplement
domestically earned income. Customs revenues plummeted during the
global economic crisis and Swaziland has appealed to SACU for
assistance. With an estimated 40% unemployment rate, Swaziland's
need to increase the number and size of small and medium enterprises
and attract foreign direct investment is acute. Overgrazing, soil
depletion, drought, and sometimes floods persist as problems for the
future. More than one-fourth of the population needed emergency food
aid in 2006-07 because of drought, and more than one-quarter of the
adult population has been infected by HIV/AIDS.

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - the government of Swaziland does
not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of
trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; the
government believes that trafficking probably does occur, but does
not know the extent of the problem; the government does not judge
trafficking to be an "important" problem and chooses to direct its
limited resources towards other issues, a judgment which
significantly limited the government's current efforts to eliminate
human trafficking, or to plan anti-trafficking activities or
initiatives for the future (2010)
