Economy ::Micronesia, Federated States of




Economy - overview:


Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and
fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist
industry exists, but the remote location, a lack of adequate
facilities, and limited air connections hinder development. Under
the original terms of the Compact of Free Association, the US
provided $1.3 billion in grant aid during the period 1986-2001; the
level of aid has been subsequently reduced. The Amended Compact of
Free Association with the US guarantees the Federated States of
Micronesia (FSM) millions of dollars in annual aid through 2023, and
establishes a Trust Fund into which the US and the FSM make annual
contributions in order to provide annual payouts to the FSM in
perpetuity after 2023. The country's medium-term economic outlook
appears fragile due not only to the reduction in US assistance but
also to the current slow growth of the private sector.
