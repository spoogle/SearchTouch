Suriname  (South America)

Introduction ::Suriname




Background:


First explored by the Spaniards in the 16th century and then settled
by the English in the mid-17th century, Suriname became a Dutch
colony in 1667. With the abolition of slavery in 1863, workers were
brought in from India and Java. Independence from the Netherlands
was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was
replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist
republic. It continued to exert control through a succession of
nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when international
pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1990, the military
overthrew the civilian leadership, but a democratically elected
government - a four-party coalition - returned to power in 1991. The
coalition expanded to eight parties in 2005 and has continued to
rule since.

Economy ::Suriname




Economy - overview:


The economy is dominated by the mining industry, with exports of
alumina, gold, and oil accounting for about 85% of exports and 25%
of government revenues, making the economy highly vulnerable to
mineral price volatility. In 2000, the government of Ronald
VENETIAAN, returned to office and inherited an economy with
inflation of over 100% and a growing fiscal deficit. He quickly
implemented an austerity program, raised taxes, attempted to control
spending, and tamed inflation. Economic growth reached about 6% in
2007 and 2008, owing to sizeable foreign investment in mining and
oil. Suriname has received aid for projects in the bauxite and gold
mining sectors from Netherlands, Belgium, and the European
Development Fund. The economy contracted in 2009, however, as
investment waned and the country earned less from its commodity
exports when global prices for most commodities fell. Trade picked
up, boosting Suriname's economic growth in 2010, but the
government's budget remained strained, with increased social
spending during last year's election. Suriname's economic prospects
for the medium term will depend on continued commitment to
responsible monetary and fiscal policies and to the introduction of
structural reforms to liberalize markets and promote competition.
