Cambodia  (East & Southeast Asia)

Introduction ::Cambodia




Background:


Most Cambodians consider themselves to be Khmers, descendants of the
Angkor Empire that extended over much of Southeast Asia and reached
its zenith between the 10th and 13th centuries. Attacks by the Thai
and Cham (from present-day Vietnam) weakened the empire, ushering in
a long period of decline. The king placed the country under French
protection in 1863 and it became part of French Indochina in 1887.
Following Japanese occupation in World War II, Cambodia gained full
independence from France in 1953. In April 1975, after a five-year
struggle, Communist Khmer Rouge forces captured Phnom Penh and
evacuated all cities and towns. At least 1.5 million Cambodians died
from execution, forced hardships, or starvation during the Khmer
Rouge regime under POL POT. A December 1978 Vietnamese invasion
drove the Khmer Rouge into the countryside, began a 10-year
Vietnamese occupation, and touched off almost 13 years of civil war.
The 1991 Paris Peace Accords mandated democratic elections and a
ceasefire, which was not fully respected by the Khmer Rouge.
UN-sponsored elections in 1993 helped restore some semblance of
normalcy under a coalition government. Factional fighting in 1997
ended the first coalition government, but a second round of national
elections in 1998 led to the formation of another coalition
government and renewed political stability. The remaining elements
of the Khmer Rouge surrendered in early 1999. Some of the surviving
Khmer Rouge leaders have been tried or are awaiting trial for crimes
against humanity by a hybrid UN-Cambodian tribunal supported by
international assistance. Elections in July 2003 were relatively
peaceful, but it took one year of negotiations between contending
political parties before a coalition government was formed. In
October 2004, King Norodom SIHANOUK abdicated the throne and his
son, Prince Norodom SIHAMONI, was selected to succeed him. Local
elections were held in Cambodia in April 2007, with little of the
pre-election violence that preceded prior elections. National
elections in July 2008 were relatively peaceful.

Economy ::Cambodia




Economy - overview:


From 2004 to 2007, the economy grew about 10% per year, driven
largely by an expansion in the garment sector, construction,
agriculture, and tourism. GDP contracted 1.5% in 2009 as a result of
the global economic slowdown, but climbed more than 4% in 1010,
driven by renewed exports. With the January 2005 expiration of a WTO
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, Cambodian textile producers were
forced to compete directly with lower-priced countries such as
China, India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The garment industry
currently employs more than 280,000 people - about 5% of the work
force - and contributes more than 70% of Cambodia's exports. In
2005, exploitable oil deposits were found beneath Cambodia's
territorial waters, representing a new revenue stream for the
government if commercial extraction begins. Mining also is
attracting significant investor interest, particularly in the
northern parts of the country. The government has said opportunities
exist for mining bauxite, gold, iron and gems. In 2006, a
US-Cambodia bilateral Trade and Investment Framework Agreement
(TIFA) was signed, and several rounds of discussions have been held
since 2007. Rubber exports increased about 25% in 2009 due to rising
global demand. The tourism industry has continued to grow rapidly,
with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007-08,
however, economic troubles abroad dampened growth in 2009. The
global financial crisis is weakening demand for Cambodian exports,
and construction is declining due to a shortage of credit. The
long-term development of the economy remains a daunting challenge.
The Cambodian government is working with bilateral and multilateral
donors, including the World Bank and IMF, to address the country's
many pressing needs. The major economic challenge for Cambodia over
the next decade will be fashioning an economic environment in which
the private sector can create enough jobs to handle Cambodia's
demographic imbalance. More than 50% of the population is less than
25 years old. The population lacks education and productive skills,
particularly in the poverty-ridden countryside, which suffers from
an almost total lack of basic infrastructure.
