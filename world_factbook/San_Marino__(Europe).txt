San Marino  (Europe)

Introduction ::San Marino




Background:


The third smallest state in Europe (after the Holy See and Monaco),
San Marino also claims to be the world's oldest republic. According
to tradition, it was founded by a Christian stonemason named Marinus
in A.D. 301. San Marino's foreign policy is aligned with that of
Italy; social and political trends in the republic also track
closely with those of its larger neighbor.

Economy ::San Marino




Economy - overview:


San Marino's economy relies heavily on its tourism and banking
industries, as well as on the manufacture and export of ceramics,
clothing, fabrics, furniture, paints, spirits, tiles, and wine. The
per capita level of output and standard of living are comparable to
those of the most prosperous regions of Italy, which supplies much
of its food. San Marino boasts the world's longest life expectancy
for men with 80 years. The economy benefits from foreign investment
due to its relatively low corporate taxes and low taxes on interest
earnings. San Marino has recently faced increased international
pressure to improve cooperation with foreign tax authorities and
transparency within its own banking sector, which generates about
one-fifth of the country's tax revenues. Italy's implementation in
October 2009 of a tax amnesty to repatriate untaxed funds held
abroad has resulted in financial outflows from San Marino to Italy
worth more than $4.5 billion. Such outflows, combined with a
money-laundering scandal at San Marino's largest financial
institution and the recent global economic downturn, have
contributed to a deep recession and growing budget deficit. However,
San Marino has no national debt, and an unemployment rate half the
size of Italy's. The San Marino government has adopted measures to
counter the downturn, including subsidized credit to businesses. San
Marino also continues to work towards harmonizing its fiscal laws
with EU members and international standards. In September 2009, the
OECD removed San Marino from its list of tax havens that have yet to
fully implement global tax standards.
