Sint Maarten  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Sint Maarten




Background:


Although sighted by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1493 and claimed for
Spain, it was the Dutch who occupied the island in 1631 and set
about exploiting its salt deposits. The Spanish retook the island in
1633, but continued to be harassed by the Dutch. The Spanish finally
relinquished the island of Saint Martin to the French and Dutch, who
divided it amongst themselves in 1648. The establishment of cotton,
tobacco, and sugar plantations dramatically expanded slavery on the
island in the 18th and 19th centuries; the practice was not
abolished in the Dutch half until 1863. The island's economy
declined until 1939 when it became a free port; the tourism industry
was dramatically expanded beginning in the 1950s. In 1954, Sint
Maarten and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions became part of
the Kingdom of the Netherlands as the Netherlands Antilles. In a
2000 referendum, the citizens of Sint Maarten voted to become a
self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The
change in status became effective in October of 2010 with the
dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.

Economy - overview:


The economy of Sint Maarten centers around tourism with nearly
four-fifths of the labor force engaged in this sector. Over one
million visitors come to the island each year - 1.3 million in 2008
- with most arriving through the Princess Juliana International
Airport. Cruise ships and yachts also call on Sint Maarten's
numerous ports and harbors. No significant agriculture and limited
local fishing means that almost all food must be imported. Energy
resources and manufactured goods are also imported. Sint Maarten had
the highest per capita income among the five islands that formerly
comprised the Netherlands Antilles.
