France  (Europe)

Introduction ::France




Background:


Although ultimately a victor in World Wars I and II, France suffered
extensive losses in its empire, wealth, manpower, and rank as a
dominant nation-state. Nevertheless, France today is one of the most
modern countries in the world and is a leader among European
nations. Since 1958, it has constructed a hybrid
presidential-parliamentary governing system resistant to the
instabilities experienced in earlier more purely parliamentary
administrations. In recent years, its reconciliation and cooperation
with Germany have proved central to the economic integration of
Europe, including the introduction of a common exchange currency,
the euro, in January 1999.

Economy ::France




Economy - overview:


France is in the midst of transition from a well-to-do modern
economy that has featured extensive government ownership and
intervention to one that relies more on market mechanisms. The
government has partially or fully privatized many large companies,
banks, and insurers, and has ceded stakes in such leading firms as
Air France, France Telecom, Renault, and Thales. It maintains a
strong presence in some sectors, particularly power, public
transport, and defense industries. With at least 75 million foreign
tourists per year, France is the most visited country in the world
and maintains the third largest income in the world from tourism.
France's leaders remain committed to a capitalism in which they
maintain social equity by means of laws, tax policies, and social
spending that reduce income disparity and the impact of free markets
on public health and welfare. France has weathered the global
economic crisis better than most other big EU economies because of
the relative resilience of domestic consumer spending, a large
public sector, and less exposure to the downturn in global demand
than in some other countries. Nonetheless, France's real GDP
contracted 2.5% in 2009, but recovered somewhat in 2010, while the
unemployment rate increased from 7.4% in 2008 to 9.5% in 2010. The
government pursuit of aggressive stimulus and investment measures in
response to the economic crisis, however, are contributing to a
deterioration of France's public finances. The government budget
deficit rose sharply from 3.4% of GDP in 2008 to 7.8% of GDP in
2010, while France's public debt rose from 68% of GDP to 84% over
the same period. Paris is terminating stimulus measures, eliminating
tax credits, and freezing most government spending to bring the
budget deficit under the 3% euro-zone ceiling by 2013, and to
highlight France's commitment to fiscal discipline at a time of
intense financial market scrutiny of euro zone debt levels.
President SARKOZY - who secured passage of pension reform in 2010 -
is expected to seek passage of some tax reforms in 2011, but he may
delay additional, more costly, reforms until after the 2012 election.
