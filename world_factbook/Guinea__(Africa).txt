Guinea  (Africa)

Introduction ::Guinea




Background:


Guinea has had a history of authoritarian rule since gaining its
independence from France in 1958. Lansana CONTE came to power in
1984 when the military seized the government after the death of the
first president, Sekou TOURE. Guinea did not hold democratic
elections until 1993 when Gen. CONTE (head of the military
government) was elected president of the civilian government. He was
reelected in 1998 and again in 2003, though all the polls were
marred by irregularities. History repeated itself in December 2008
when following President CONTE's death, Capt. Moussa Dadis CAMARA
led a military coup, seizing power and suspending the constitution.
His unwillingness to yield to domestic and international pressure to
step down led to heightened political tensions that culminated in
September 2009 when presidential guards opened fire on an opposition
rally killing more than 150 people, and in early December 2009 when
CAMARA was wounded in an assassination attempt and evacuated to
Morocco and subsequently to Burkina Faso. A transitional government
led by General Sekouba KONATE held democratic elections in 2010 and
Alpha CONDE was elected president in the country's first free and
fair elections since independence.

Economy ::Guinea




Economy - overview:


Guinea is a poor country that possesses major mineral, hydropower,
and agricultural resources. The country has almost half of the
world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector accounts for more than
70% of exports. Long-run improvements in the management of the
economy, literacy, and the legal framework are needed if the country
is to move out of poverty. Investor confidence has been sapped by
rampant corruption, a lack of electricity and other infrastructure,
a lack of skilled workers, and the political uncertainty resulting
from the death of President Lansana CONTE in December 2008.
International donors, including the G-8, the IMF, and the World
Bank, cut their development programming significantly in response to
the coup, and international partners have said that a resumption of
aid will be contingent on a successful democratic transition with a
democratically elected president and a functioning National
Assembly. Growth rose slightly in 2006-08, primarily due to
increases in global demand and commodity prices on world markets,
but bauxite and alumina exports were negatively affected by the
global economic downturn and the economy in 2009 contracted.
International investors expressed renewed interest in Guinea's iron
ore mines in 2010.

Transnational Issues ::Guinea




Disputes - international:


conflicts among rebel groups, warlords, and youth gangs in
neighboring states have spilled over into Guinea resulting in
domestic instability; Sierra Leone considers Guinea's definition of
the flood plain limits to define the left bank boundary of the
Makona and Moa rivers excessive and protests Guinea's continued
occupation of these lands, including the hamlet of Yenga, occupied
since 1998



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 21,856 (Liberia); 5,259 (Sierra
Leone); 3,900 (Cote d'Ivoire)

IDPs: 19,000 (cross-border incursions from Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia,
Sierra Leone) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Guinea is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
forced labor and sexual exploitation; the majority of victims are
children, and internal trafficking is more prevalent than
transnational trafficking; within the country, girls are trafficked
primarily for domestic servitude and sexual exploitation, while boys
are trafficked for forced agricultural labor, and as forced beggars,
street vendors, shoe shiners, and laborers in gold and diamond
mines; some Guinean men are also trafficked for agricultural labor
within Guinea; transnationally, girls are trafficked into Guinea for
domestic servitude and likely also for sexual exploitation

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Guinea is on the Tier 2 Watch List
for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
eliminate trafficking over 2006; Guinea demonstrated minimal law
enforcement efforts for a second year in a row, while protection
efforts diminished over efforts in 2006; the government did not
report any trafficking convictions in 2007; due to a lack of
resources, the government does not provide shelter services for
trafficking victims; the government took no measures to reduce the
demand for commercial sexual exploitation (2008)
