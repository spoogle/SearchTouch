Tajikistan  (Central Asia)

Introduction ::Tajikistan




Background:


The Tajik people came under Russian rule in the 1860s and 1870s, but
Russia's hold on Central Asia weakened following the Revolution of
1917. Bolshevik control of the area was fiercely contested and not
fully reestablished until 1925. Much of present-day Sughd province
was transferred from the Uzbek SSR to the newly formed Tajik SSR in
1929. Ethnic Uzbeks form a substantial minority in Sughd province.
Tajikistan became independent in 1991 following the breakup of the
Soviet Union, and experienced a civil war between regional factions
from 1992-97. There have been no major security incidents in recent
years, although the country remains the poorest in the former Soviet
sphere. Attention by the international community since the beginning
of the NATO intervention in Afghanistan has brought increased
economic development and security assistance, which could create
jobs and strengthen stability in the long term. Tajikistan is in the
early stages of seeking World Trade Organization membership and has
joined NATO's Partnership for Peace.

Economy ::Tajikistan




Economy - overview:


Tajikistan has one of the lowest per capita GDPs among the 15 former
Soviet republics. Because of a lack of employment opportunities in
Tajikistan, nearly half of the labor force works abroad, primarily
in Russia and Kazakhstan, supporting families in Tajikistan through
remittances. The exact number of labor migrants is unknown, but
estimated at around 1 million. Less than 7% of the land area is
arable. Cotton is the most important crop, but this sector is
burdened with debt and obsolete infrastructure; moreover, government
has encouraged a gradual transition away from cotton and towards
food cultivation due to its concerns about feeding the population.
Mineral resources include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten.
Industry consists only of a large aluminum plant, hydropower
facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry
and food processing. The civil war (1992-97) severely damaged the
already weak economic infrastructure and caused a sharp decline in
industrial and agricultural production. Tajikistan's economic
situation remains fragile due to uneven implementation of structural
reforms, corruption, weak governance, seasonal power shortages, and
the external debt burden. A debt restructuring agreement was reached
with Russia in December 2002, including a $250 million write-off of
Tajikistan's $300 million debt. Completion of the Sangtuda I
hydropower dam - finished in 2009 with Russian investment - and the
Sangtuda II and Rogun dams will add substantially to electricity
output. If finished according to Tajik plans, Rogun will be the
world's tallest dam. The World Bank, in 2010, agreed to fund safety
and feasibility studies for the Rogun Dam. Favorable reports from
these studies could increase investor interest in the project, which
has been stalled due to lack of funding. Tajikistan has also
received substantial infrastructure development loans from the
Chinese government to improve roads and an electricity transmission
network. To help increase north-south trade, the US funded a $36
million bridge which opened in August 2007 and links Tajikistan and
Afghanistan. While Tajikistan has experienced steady economic growth
since 1997, more than half of the population continues to live in
poverty. Economic growth reached 10.6% in 2004, but dropped below 8%
in 2005-08, as the effects of higher oil prices and then the
international financial crisis began to register - mainly in the
form of lower prices for key export commodities and lower
remittances from Tajiks working abroad, due to the global economic
downturn. In 2009 GDP growth dropped to 3.4% as a result of the
world recession.

Transnational Issues ::Tajikistan




Disputes - international:


in 2006, China and Tajikistan pledged to commence demarcation of the
revised boundary agreed to in the delimitation of 2002; talks
continue with Uzbekistan to delimit border and remove minefields;
disputes in Isfara Valley delay delimitation with Kyrgyzstan



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Tajikistan is a source country for women
trafficked through Kyrgyzstan and Russia to the UAE, Turkey, and
Russia for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation; men are
trafficked to Russia and Kazakhstan for the purpose of forced labor,
primarily in the construction and agricultural industries; boys and
girls are trafficked internally for various purposes, including
forced labor and forced begging

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Tajikistan is on the Tier 2 Watch
List for its failure to provide evidence of increasing efforts to
combat human trafficking, especially efforts to investigate,
prosecute, convict, and sentence traffickers; despite evidence of
low- and mid-level officials' complicity in trafficking, the
government did not punish any public officials for trafficking
complicity during 2007; lack of capacity and poor coordination
between government institutions remained key obstacles to effective
anti-trafficking efforts (2008)



Illicit drugs:


major transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and, to
a lesser extent, Western European markets; limited illicit
cultivation of opium poppy for domestic consumption; Tajikistan
seizes roughly 80% of all drugs captured in Central Asia and stands
third worldwide in seizures of opiates (heroin and raw opium);
significant consumer of opiates
