Venezuela  (South America)

Introduction ::Venezuela




Background:


Venezuela was one of three countries that emerged from the collapse
of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others being Ecuador and New Granada,
which became Colombia). For most of the first half of the 20th
century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military
strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social
reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since
1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president since 1999, seeks to implement his
"21st Century Socialism," which purports to alleviate social ills
while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and
existing democratic institutions. Current concerns include: a
weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a
politicized military, drug-related violence along the Colombian
border, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price
fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are
endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.

three equal horizontal bands of yellow (top), blue, and red with the
coat of arms on the hoist side of the yellow band and an arc of
eight white five-pointed stars centered in the blue band; the flag
retains the three equal horizontal bands and three main colors of
the banner of Gran Colombia, the South American republic that broke
up in 1830; yellow is interpreted as standing for the riches of the
land, blue for the courage of its people, and red for the blood shed
in attaining independence; the seven stars on the original flag
represented the seven provinces in Venezuela that united in the war
of independence; in 2006, President Hugo CHAVEZ ordered an eighth
star added to the star arc - a decision that sparked much controversy



National anthem:

Economy ::Venezuela




Economy - overview:


Venezuela remains highly dependent on oil revenues, which account
for roughly 95% of export earnings, about 55% of the federal budget
revenues, and around 30% of GDP. A nationwide strike between
December 2002 and February 2003 had far-reaching economic
consequences - real GDP declined by around 9% in 2002 and 8% in 2003
- but economic output since then has recovered strongly. Fueled by
high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP by
about 10% in 2006, 8% in 2007, and nearly 5% in 2008, before a sharp
drop in oil prices caused a contraction in 2009-10. This spending,
combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to
domestic credit, has created a consumption boom but has come at the
cost of higher inflation - roughly 32% in 2008, and slowing only
slightly to 30% in 2010, despite the lengthy downturn. Imports also
jumped significantly before the recession of 2009. President Hugo
CHAVEZ's continued efforts to increase the government's control of
the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial,
construction, oil, and steel sectors have hurt the private
investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowed
non-petroleum exports. In the first half of 2010 Venezuela faced the
prospect of lengthy nationwide blackouts when its main hydroelectric
power plant - which provides more than 35% of the country's
electricity - nearly shut down. In January, 2010, CHAVEZ announced a
dual exchange rate system for the bolivar and closed the unofficial
foreign exchange market - the "parallel" market - in an effort to
stem inflation and slow the currency's depreciation. The foreign
exchange system offers a 2.6 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of
essentials, including food, medicine, and industrial machinery, and
a 4.3 bolivar per dollar rate for imports of other products,
including cars and telephones.

Transnational Issues ::Venezuela




Disputes - international:


claims all of the area west of the Essequibo River in Guyana,
preventing any discussion of a maritime boundary; Guyana has
expressed its intention to join Barbados in asserting claims before
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that
Trinidad and Tobago's maritime boundary with Venezuela extends into
their waters; dispute with Colombia over maritime boundary and
Venezuelan-administered Los Monjes islands near the Gulf of
Venezuela; Colombian-organized illegal narcotics and paramilitary
activities penetrate Venezuela's shared border region; in 2006, an
estimated 139,000 Colombians sought protection in 150 communities
along the border in Venezuela; US, France, and the Netherlands
recognize Venezuela's granting full effect to Aves Island, thereby
claiming a Venezuelan EEZ/continental shelf extending over a large
portion of the eastern Caribbean Sea; Dominica, Saint Kitts and
Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines protest
Venezuela's full effect claim



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Venezuela is a source, transit, and destination
country for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of
commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; Venezuelan women
and girls are trafficked within the country for sexual exploitation,
lured from the nation's interior to urban and tourist areas; child
prostitution in urban areas and child sex tourism in resort
destinations appear to be growing; Venezuelan women and girls are
trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation to Western Europe,
Mexico, and Caribbean destinations

tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List - Venezuela is placed on the Tier 2
Watch List, up from Tier 3, as it showed greater resolve to address
trafficking through law enforcement measures and prevention efforts
in 2007, although stringent punishment of offenders and victim
assistance remain lacking (2008)



Illicit drugs:


small-scale illicit producer of opium and coca for the processing of
opiates and coca derivatives; however, large quantities of cocaine,
heroin, and marijuana transit the country from Colombia bound for US
and Europe; significant narcotics-related money-laundering activity,
especially along the border with Colombia and on Margarita Island;
active eradication program primarily targeting opium; increasing
signs of drug-related activities by Colombian insurgents on border
