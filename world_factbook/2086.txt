Field Listing :: Illicit drugs

  This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs
  - narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and
  cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and
  prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold
  outside of medical channels.
  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
  hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
  (pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
  Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
  Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain
  the stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with
  cocoa, which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate,
  cocoa, and cocoa butter.
  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.
  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety
  and include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal,
  Seconal, phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium),
  methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others
  (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).
  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,
  emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.
  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance
  that results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral
  impairment in an individual.
  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
  self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
  microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
  variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
  phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
  psilocyn).
  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
  (Cannabis sativa).
  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
  Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical
  depressant.
  Marijuana is the dried leaf of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
  sativa).
  Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax
  in Southwest Asia and Africa.
  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer
  to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural
  narcotics include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine
  (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with
  codeine, Robitussin AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics
  include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
  Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol,
  Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon,
  Lomotil).
  Opium is the brown, gummy exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of
  the opium poppy.
  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for the natural and
  semisynthetic narcotics.
  Poppy straw is the entire cut and dried opium poppy-plant material,
  other than the seeds. Opium is extracted from poppy straw in
  commercial operations that produce the drug for medical use.
  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha
  edulis that is chewed or drunk as tea.
  Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
  pharmaceutical depressant.
  Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy
  and activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
  (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), ephedrine, ecstasy (clarity, essence, doctor,
  Adam), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and
  others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).
  Country


  Illicit drugs

Afghanistan
  world's largest producer of opium; poppy cultivation
  decreased 22% to 157,000 hectares in 2008 but remains at a
  historically high level; less favorable growing conditions in 2008
  reduced potential opium production to 5,500 metric tons, down 31
  percent from 2007; if the entire opium crop were processed, 648
  metric tons of pure heroin potentially could be produced; the
  Taliban and other antigovernment groups participate in and profit
  from the opiate trade, which is a key source of revenue for the
  Taliban inside Afghanistan; widespread corruption and instability

  increase from 2007; production in the United Wa State Army's areas
  of greatest control remains low; Shan state is the source of 94% of
  Burma's poppy cultivation; lack of government will to take on major
  narcotrafficking groups and lack of serious commitment against money
  laundering continues to hinder the overall antidrug effort; major
  source of methamphetamine and heroin for regional consumption (2008)

Cambodia
  narcotics-related corruption reportedly involving some in
  the government, military, and police; limited methamphetamine
  production; vulnerable to money laundering due to its cash-based
  economy and porous borders

Canada
  illicit producer of cannabis for the domestic drug market and
  export to US; use of hydroponics technology permits growers to plant
  large quantities of high-quality marijuana indoors; increasing
  ecstasy production, some of which is destined for the US; vulnerable
  to narcotics money laundering because of its mature financial
  services sector

Cape Verde
  used as a transshipment point for Latin American cocaine
  destined for Western Europe, particularly because of Lusophone links
  to Brazil, Portugal, and Guinea-Bissau; has taken steps to deter

  derivatives; supplies cocaine to nearly all of the US market and the
  great majority of other international drug markets; in 2005, aerial
  eradication dispensed herbicide to treat over 130,000 hectares but
  aggressive replanting on the part of coca growers means Colombia
  remains a key producer; a significant portion of narcotics proceeds
  are either laundered or invested in Colombia through the black
  market peso exchange; important supplier of heroin to the US market;

  and 2007; most Colombian heroin is destined for the US market (2008)

Congo, Democratic Republic of the
  one of Africa's biggest producers
  of cannabis, but mostly for domestic consumption; traffickers
  exploit lax shipping controls to transit pseudoephedrine through the
  capital; while rampant corruption and inadequate supervision leaves
  the banking system vulnerable to money laundering, the lack of a
  well-developed financial system limits the country's utility as a
  money-laundering center (2008)

Costa Rica
  transshipment country for cocaine and heroin from South
  America; illicit production of cannabis in remote areas; domestic
  cocaine consumption, particularly crack cocaine, is rising;

  in Costa Rica and at the main border crossing to enter Costa Rica
  from Nicaragua have risen in recent years (2008)

Cote d'Ivoire
  illicit producer of cannabis, mostly for local
  consumption; utility as a narcotic transshipment point to Europe
  reduced by ongoing political instability; while rampant corruption
  and inadequate supervision leave the banking system vulnerable to
  money laundering, the lack of a developed financial system limits
  the country's utility as a major money-laundering center (2008)

  staging area for drugs (particularly for cocaine); money laundering
  is a serious problem; corruption is a major problem

Guinea-Bissau
  increasingly important transit country for South
  American cocaine enroute to Europe; enabling environment for

  illicit producer of cannabis (cultivated and wild
  varieties) used mostly for domestic consumption; transshipment point
  for heroin

Malaysia
  drug trafficking prosecuted vigorously and carries severe

Malta
  minor transshipment point for hashish from North Africa to
  Western Europe

Mauritius
  consumer and transshipment point for heroin from South
  Asia; small amounts of cannabis produced and consumed locally;
  significant offshore financial industry creates potential for money

  government appears generally to be committed to regulating its
  banking industry

Mexico
  major drug-producing nation; cultivation of opium poppy in
  2007 rose to 6,900 hectares yielding a potential production of 18
  metric tons of pure heroin, or 50 metric tons of "black tar" heroin,

  point for cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe;
  significant consumer of cannabis

Mozambique
  southern African transit point for South Asian hashish
  and heroin, and South American cocaine probably destined for the
  European and South African markets; producer of cannabis (for local
