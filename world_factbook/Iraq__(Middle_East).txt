Iraq  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Iraq




Background:


Formerly part of the Ottoman Empire, Iraq was occupied by Britain
during the course of World War I; in 1920, it was declared a League
of Nations mandate under UK administration. In stages over the next
dozen years, Iraq attained its independence as a kingdom in 1932. A
"republic" was proclaimed in 1958, but in actuality a series of
strongmen ruled the country until 2003. The last was SADDAM Husayn.
Territorial disputes with Iran led to an inconclusive and costly
eight-year war (1980-88). In August 1990, Iraq seized Kuwait but was
expelled by US-led, UN coalition forces during the Gulf War of
January-February 1991. Following Kuwait's liberation, the UN
Security Council (UNSC) required Iraq to scrap all weapons of mass
destruction and long-range missiles and to allow UN verification
inspections. Continued Iraqi noncompliance with UNSC resolutions
over a period of 12 years led to the US-led invasion of Iraq in
March 2003 and the ouster of the SADDAM Husayn regime. US forces
remained in Iraq under a UNSC mandate through 2009 and under a
bilateral security agreement thereafter, helping to provide security
and to train and mentor Iraqi security forces. In October 2005,
Iraqis approved a constitution in a national referendum and,
pursuant to this document, elected a 275-member Council of
Representatives (CoR) in December 2005. After the election, Ibrahim
al-JAFARI was selected as prime minister; he was replaced by Nuri
al-MALIKI in May 2006. The CoR approved most cabinet ministers in
May 2006, marking the transition to Iraq's first constitutional
government in nearly a half century. On 31 January 2009, Iraq held
elections for provincial councils in all provinces except for the
three provinces comprising the Kurdistan Regional Government and
Kirkuk province. Iraq held a national legislative election in March
2010, and after nine months of deadlock the CoR approved the new
government in December.

Area:


total: 438,317 sq km
country comparison to the world: 58
land: 437,367 sq km

water: 950 sq km



Area - comparative:


slightly more than twice the size of Idaho



Land boundaries:


total: 3,650 km

border countries: Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 240 km, Saudi
Arabia 814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 352 km



Coastline:


58 km



Maritime claims:


territorial sea: 12 nm

continental shelf: not specified



Climate:


mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry, hot, cloudless
summers; northern mountainous regions along Iranian and Turkish
borders experience cold winters with occasionally heavy snows that
melt in early spring, sometimes causing extensive flooding in
central and southern Iraq



Terrain:


mostly broad plains; reedy marshes along Iranian border in south
with large flooded areas; mountains along borders with Iran and
Turkey



Elevation extremes:


lowest point: Persian Gulf 0 m

highest point: unnamed peak; 3,611 m; note - this peak is neither

dust storms; sandstorms; floods



Environment - current issues:


government water control projects have drained most of the inhabited
marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting the
feeder streams and rivers; a once sizable population of Marsh Arabs,
who inhabited these areas for thousands of years, has been
displaced; furthermore, the destruction of the natural habitat poses
serious threats to the area's wildlife populations; inadequate
supplies of potable water; development of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers system contingent upon agreements with upstream riparian
Turkey; air and water pollution; soil degradation (salination) and
erosion; desertification



Environment - international agreements:


party to: Biodiversity, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection

signed, but not ratified: Environmental Modification

Economy ::Iraq




Economy - overview:


An improved security environment and an initial wave of foreign
investment are helping to spur economic activity, particularly in
the energy, construction, and retail sectors. Broader economic
improvement, long-term fiscal health, and sustained increases in the
standard of living still depend on the government passing major
policy reforms and on continued development of Iraq's massive oil
reserves. Although foreign investors viewed Iraq with increasing
interest in 2010, most are still hampered by difficulties in
acquiring land for projects and by other regulatory impediments.
Iraq's economy is dominated by the oil sector, which provides over
90% of government revenue and 80% of foreign exchange earnings.
Since mid-2009, oil export earnings have returned to levels seen
before Operation Iraqi Freedom and government revenues have
rebounded, along with global oil prices. In 2011 Baghdad probably
will increase oil exports above the current level of 1.9 million
barrels per day (bbl/day) as a result of new contracts with
international oil companies, but is likely to fall short of the 2.4
million bbl/day it is forecasting in its budget. Iraq is making
modest progress in building the institutions needed to implement
economic policy. In 2010, Bagdad signed a new agreement with both
the IMF and World Bank for conditional aid programs that will help
strengthen Iraq's economic institutions. Some reform-minded leaders
within the Iraqi government are seeking to pass laws to strengthen
the economy. This legislation includes a package of laws to
establish a modern legal framework for the oil sector and a
mechanism to equitably divide oil revenues within the nation,
although these and other important reforms are still under
contentious and sporadic negotiation. Iraq's recent contracts with
major oil companies have the potential to greatly expand oil
revenues, but Iraq will need to upgrade its oil processing,
pipeling, and export infrastructure to enable these deals to reach
their potential. The Government of Iraq is pursuing a strategy to
gain additional foreign investment in Iraq's economy. This includes
an amendment to the National Investment Law, multiple international
trade and investment events, as well as potential participation in
joint ventures with state-owned enterprises. Provincial Councils
also are using their own budgets to promote and facilitate
investment at the local level. However, widespread corruption,
inadequate infrastructure, insufficient essential services, and
antiquated commercial laws and regulations stifle investment and
continue to constrain the growth of private, non-energy sectors. The
Central Bank has successfully held the exchange rate at
approximately 1,170 Iraqi dinar/US dollar since January 2009.
Inflation has decreased consistently since 2006 as the security
situation has improved. However, Iraqi leaders remain hard pressed
to translate macroeconomic gains into improved lives for ordinary
Iraqis. Unemployment remains a problem throughout the country.
Reducing corruption and implementing reforms - such as bank
restructuring and developing the private sector - would be important
steps in this direction.

telecommunications throughout Iraq including international
connections; widespread government efforts to rebuild domestic and

progress; the mobile cellular market has expanded rapidly and its
subscribership base is expected to continue increasing rapidly

domestic: repairs to switches and lines destroyed during 2003
continue; additional switching capacity is improving access;
mobile-cellular service is available and centered on 3 GSM networks
which are being expanded beyond their regional roots, improving
country-wide connectivity; wireless local loop is available in some
metropolitan areas and additional licenses have been issued with the
hope of overcoming the lack of fixed-line infrastructure

Intelsat - 1 Atlantic Ocean and 1 Indian Ocean, 1 Intersputnik -

Turkey; international terrestrial fiber-optic connections have been

connections to Iran and Jordan; a link to the Fiber-Optic Link
Around the Globe (FLAG) submarine fiber-optic cable is planned (2009)
