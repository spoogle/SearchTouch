Dominican Republic  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Dominican Republic




Background:


Explored and claimed by Christopher COLUMBUS on his first voyage in
1492, the island of Hispaniola became a springboard for Spanish
conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain
recognized French dominion over the western third of the island,
which in 1804 became Haiti. The remainder of the island, by then
known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence in 1821
but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally
attained independence as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861,
the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish Empire, but two
years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865.
A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed,
capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930-61.
Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a
military coup in 1963. In 1965, the United States led an
intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to
restore BOSCH. In 1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in an
election to become president. BALAGUER maintained a tight grip on
power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to
flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 1996. Since then,
regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition
candidates have won the presidency. Former President (1996-2000)
Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna won election to a new term in 2004 following
a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than
one term, and was since reelected to a second consecutive term.

Economy ::Dominican Republic




Economy - overview:


The Dominican Republic has long been viewed primarily as an exporter
of sugar, coffee, and tobacco, but in recent years the service
sector has overtaken agriculture as the economy's largest employer,
due to growth in tourism and free trade zones. The economy is highly
dependent upon the US, the destination for nearly 60% of exports.
Remittances from the US amount to about a tenth of GDP, equivalent
to almost half of exports and three-quarters of tourism receipts.
The country suffers from marked income inequality; the poorest half
of the population receives less than one-fifth of GDP, while the
richest 10% enjoys nearly 40% of GDP. High unemployment and
underemployment remains an important long-term challenge. The
Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR)
came into force in March 2007, boosting investment and exports and
reducing losses to the Asian garment industry. The growth of the
Dominican Republic's economy slowed in 2008-09 because of the global
recession, but still remained one of the fastest growing in the
region.

Trafficking in persons:


current situation: the Dominican Republic is a source, transit, and
destination country for men, women, and children trafficked for the
purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor; a large
number of Dominican women are trafficked into prostitution and
sexual exploitation in Western Europe, Australia, Central and South
America, and Caribbean destinations; a significant number of women,
boys, and girls are trafficked within the country for sexual
exploitation and domestic servitude

tier rating: Tier 3 - for its failure to show evidence of increasing
efforts to combat human trafficking, particularly in terms of not
adequately investigating and prosecuting public officials who may be
complicit with trafficking activity, and inadequate government
efforts to protect trafficking victims; the government has taken
measures to reduce demand for commercial sex acts with children
through criminal prosecutions (2008)



Illicit drugs:


transshipment point for South American drugs destined for the US and
Europe; has become a transshipment point for ecstasy from the
