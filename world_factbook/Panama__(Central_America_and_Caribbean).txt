Panama  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Panama




Background:


Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama
broke with Spain in 1821 and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador,
and Venezuela - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the latter
dissolved in 1830, Panama remained part of Colombia. With US
backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903 and promptly signed a
treaty with the US allowing for the construction of a canal and US
sovereignty over a strip of land on either side of the structure
(the Panama Canal Zone). The Panama Canal was built by the US Army
Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914. In 1977, an agreement was
signed for the complete transfer of the Canal from the US to Panama
by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and
increasing responsibility over the Canal were turned over in the
subsequent decades. With US help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was
deposed in 1989. The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the
Canal, and remaining US military bases were transferred to Panama by
the end of 1999. In October 2006, Panamanians approved an ambitious
plan (estimated to cost $5.3 billion) to expand the Canal. The
project, which began in 2007 and could double the Canal's capacity,
is expected to be completed in 2014-15.

Economy ::Panama




Economy - overview:


Panama's dollarized economy rests primarily on a well-developed
services sector that accounts for three-quarters of GDP. Services
include operating the Panama Canal, banking, the Colon Free Zone,
insurance, container ports, flagship registry, and tourism. Economic
growth will be bolstered by the Panama Canal expansion project that
began in 2007 and is scheduled to be completed by 2014 at a cost of
$5.3 billion - about 25% of current GDP. The expansion project will
more than double the Canal's capacity, enabling it to accommodate
ships that are now too large to transverse the transoceanic
crossway, and should help to reduce the unemployment rate. The
United States and China are the top users of the Canal. Panama also
plans to construct a metro system in Panama City, valued at $1.2
billion and scheduled to be completed by 2014. Panama's aggressive
infrastructure development projects will likely lead the economy to
continued growth in 2011. Strong economic performance has not
translated into broadly shared prosperity as Panama has the second
worst income distribution in Latin America. About 30% of the
population lives in poverty, however, during TORRIJOS's term poverty
was reduced from 40% to 30% and unemployment dropped from 12% to 6%.
Not a CAFTA signatory, Panama in December 2006 independently
negotiated a free trade agreement with the US, which, when
implemented, will help promote the country's economic growth.
Seeking removal from the Organization of Economic Development's
gray-list of tax havens, Panama has also recently signed various
double taxation treaties with other nations.

Legislative Assembly approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting
the creation of a standing military force but allowing the temporary
establishment of special police units to counter acts of "external
aggression"
