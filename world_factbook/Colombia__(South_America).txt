Colombia  (South America)

Introduction ::Colombia




Background:


Colombia was one of the three countries that emerged from the
collapse of Gran Colombia in 1830 (the others are Ecuador and
Venezuela). A four-decade long conflict between government forces
and anti-government insurgent groups, principally the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) heavily funded by the drug trade,
escalated during the 1990s. The insurgents lack the military or
popular support necessary to overthrow the government and violence
has been decreasing since about 2002, but insurgents continue
attacks against civilians and large areas of the countryside are
under guerrilla influence or are contested by security forces. More
than 31,000 former paramilitaries had demobilized by the end of 2006
and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) as a formal
organization had ceased to function. In the wake of the paramilitary
demobilization, emerging criminal groups arose, whose members
include some former paramilitaries. The Colombian Government has
stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the
country, and now has a presence in every one of its administrative
departments. However, neighboring countries worry about the violence
spilling over their borders. In January 2011, Colombia assumed a
nonpermanent seat on the UN Security Council for the 2011-12 term.

three horizontal bands of yellow (top, double-width), blue, and red;
the flag retains the three main colors of the banner of Gran
Columbia, the short-lived South American republic that broke up in
1830; various interpretations of the colors exist and include:
yellow for the gold in Colombia's land, blue for the seas on its
shores, and red for the blood spilled in attaining freedom;
alternatively, the colors have been described as representing more
elemental concepts such as sovereignty and justice (yellow), loyalty
and vigilance (blue), and valour and generosity (red); or simply the
principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity

note: similar to the flag of Ecuador, which is longer and bears the
Ecuadorian coat of arms superimposed in the center

Economy ::Colombia




Economy - overview:


Colombia experienced accelerating growth between 2002 and 2007,
chiefly due to improvements in domestic security, rising commodity
prices, and to President URIBE's promarket economic policies.
Foreign direct investment reached a record $10 billion in 2008, and
continues to flow in, especially in the oil sector. A series of
policies enhanced Colombia's investment climate: pro-business
reforms in the oil and gas sectors and export-led growth fueled
mainly by the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act.
Inequality, underemployment, and narcotrafficking remain significant
challenges, and Colombia's infrastructure requires major
improvements to sustain economic expansion. Because of the global
financial crisis and weakening demand for Colombia's exports,
Colombia's economy grew only 2.7% in 2008, and 0.8% in 2009 but
rebounded to around 4.5% in 2010. The government has encouraged
exporters to diversify their customer base beyond the United States
and Venezuela, traditionally Colombia's largest trading partners;
the SANTOS administration continues to pursue free trade agreements
with Asian and South American partners and awaits the approval of a
Canadian trade accord by Canada's and EU's parliaments. The business
sector remains concerned about Venezuela's trade restrictions on
Colombian exports, an appreciating domestic currency, and the
pending US Congressional approval of the US-Colombia Trade Promotion
Agreement.

general assessment: modern system in many respects with a nationwide
microwave radio relay system, a domestic satellite system with 41
earth stations, and a fiber-optic network linking 50 cities;

providers of both fixed-line and mobile-cellular services

domestic: fixed-line connections stand at about 15 per 100 persons;
mobile cellular telephone subscribership is about 90 per 100
persons; competition among cellular service providers is resulting
in falling local and international calling rates and contributing to
the steep decline in the market share of fixed line services

Transnational Issues ::Colombia




Disputes - international:


in December 2007, ICJ allocates San Andres, Providencia, and Santa
Catalina islands to Colombia under 1928 Treaty but does not rule on
82 degrees W meridian as maritime boundary with Nicaragua; managed
dispute with Venezuela over maritime boundary and
Venezuelan-administered Los Monjes Islands near the Gulf of
Venezuela; Colombian-organized illegal narcotics, guerrilla, and
paramilitary activities penetrate all neighboring borders and have
caused Colombian citizens to flee mostly into neighboring countries;
Colombia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Jamaica, and the US assert various
claims to Bajo Nuevo and Serranilla Bank



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


IDPs: 1.8-3.5 million (conflict between government and illegal armed
groups and drug traffickers) (2007)



Illicit drugs:


illicit producer of coca, opium poppy, and cannabis; world's leading
coca cultivator with 167,000 hectares in coca cultivation in 2007, a
6% increase over 2006, producing a potential of 535 mt of pure
cocaine; the world's largest producer of coca derivatives; supplies
cocaine to nearly all of the US market and the great majority of
other international drug markets; in 2005, aerial eradication
dispensed herbicide to treat over 130,000 hectares but aggressive
replanting on the part of coca growers means Colombia remains a key
producer; a significant portion of narcotics proceeds are either
laundered or invested in Colombia through the black market peso
exchange; important supplier of heroin to the US market; opium poppy
cultivation is estimated to have fallen 25% between 2006 and 2007;
most Colombian heroin is destined for the US market (2008)
