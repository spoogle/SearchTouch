Curacao  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Curacao




Background:


Originally settled by Arawak Indians, Curacao was seized by the
Dutch in 1634 along with the neighboring island of Bonaire. Once the
center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit by the
abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of
neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the
construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered
Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch
Caribbean possesions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles,
part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and
2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing
country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status
became effective in October of 2010 with the dissolution of the
Netherlands Antilles.

Economy ::Curacao




Economy - overview:


Tourism, petroleum refining, and offshore finance are the mainstays
of this small economy, which is closely tied to the outside world.
Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade, the island enjoys
a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure
compared with other countries in the region. Curacao has an
excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers. The
Venezuelan state oil company leases the single refinery on the
island from the government; most of the oil for the refinery is
imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported
to the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with
the US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major suppliers. The
government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has
signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business
there. Poor soils and inadequate water supplies hamper the
development of agriculture. Budgetary problems complicate reform of
the health and pension systems for an aging population.
