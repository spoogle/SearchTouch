American Samoa  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::American Samoa




Background:


Settled as early as 1000 B.C., Samoa was "discovered" by European
explorers in the 18th century. International rivalries in the latter
half of the 19th century were settled by an 1899 treaty in which
Germany and the US divided the Samoan archipelago. The US formally
occupied its portion - a smaller group of eastern islands with the
excellent harbor of Pago Pago - the following year.

Economy ::American Samoa




Economy - overview:


American Samoa has a traditional Polynesian economy in which more
than 90% of the land is communally owned. Economic activity is
strongly linked to the US with which American Samoa conducts most of
its commerce. Tuna fishing and tuna processing plants are the
backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna the primary export.
The two tuna canneries account for 80% of employment. In late
September 2009, an earthquake and the resulting tsunami devastated
American Samoa and nearby Samoa, disrupting transportation and power
generation, and resulting in about 200 deaths. The US Federal
Emergency Management Agency is overseeing a relief program of nearly
$25 million. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to
American Samoa's economic well being. Attempts by the government to
develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's
remote location, its limited transportation, and its devastating
hurricanes. Tourism is a promising developing sector.
