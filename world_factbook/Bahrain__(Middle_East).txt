Bahrain  (Middle East)

Introduction ::Bahrain




Background:


In 1783, the al-Khalifa family captured Bahrain from the Persians.
In order to secure these holdings, it entered into a series of
treaties with the UK during the 19th century that made Bahrain a
British protectorate. The archipelago attained its independence in
1971. Bahrain's small size and central location among Persian Gulf
countries require it to play a delicate balancing act in foreign
affairs among its larger neighbors. Facing declining oil reserves,
Bahrain has turned to petroleum processing and refining and has
transformed itself into an international banking center. King HAMAD
bin Isa al-Khalifa, after coming to power in 1999, pushed economic
and political reforms to improve relations with the Shia community.
Shia political societies participated in 2010 parliamentary and
municipal elections. Al Wifaq, the largest Shia political society,
won the largest number of seats in the elected chamber of the
legislature. However, Shia discontent has resurfaced in recent years
with street demonstrations and occasional low-level violence.

Economy ::Bahrain




Economy - overview:


Bahrain is one of the most diversified economies in the Persian
Gulf. Highly developed communication and transport facilities make
Bahrain home to numerous multinational firms with business in the
Gulf. As part of its diversification plans, Bahrain implemented a
Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the US in August 2006, the first FTA
between the US and a Gulf state. Bahrain's economy, however,
continues to depend heavily on oil. Petroleum production and
refining account for more than 60% of Bahrain's export receipts, 70%
of government revenues, and 11% of GDP (exclusive of allied
industries). Other major economic activities are production of
aluminum - Bahrain's second biggest export after oil - finance, and
construction. Bahrain competes with Malaysia as a worldwide center
for Islamic banking and continues to seek new natural gas supplies
as feedstock to support its expanding petrochemical and aluminum
industries. Unemployment, especially among the young, is a long-term
economic problem Bahrain struggles to address. In 2009, to help
lower unemployment among Bahraini nationals, Bahrain reduced
sponsorship for expatriate workers, increasing the costs of
employing foreign labor. The global financial crisis caused funding
for many non-oil projects to dry up and resulted in slower economic
growth for Bahrain. Other challenges facing Bahrain include the slow
growth of government debt as a result of a large subsidy program,
the financing of large government projects, and debt restructuring,
such as the bailout of state-owned Gulf Air.
