Introduction ::Sudan




Background:


Military regimes favoring Islamic-oriented governments have
dominated national politics since independence from the UK in 1956.
Sudan was embroiled in two prolonged civil wars during most of the
remainder of the 20th century. These conflicts were rooted in
northern economic, political, and social domination of largely
non-Muslim, non-Arab southern Sudanese. The first civil war ended in
1972 but broke out again in 1983. The second war and famine-related
effects resulted in more than four million people displaced and,
according to rebel estimates, more than two million deaths over a
period of two decades. Peace talks gained momentum in 2002-04 with
the signing of several accords. The final North/South Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA), signed in January 2005, granted the southern
rebels autonomy for six years. After which, a referendum for
independence is scheduled to be held. A separate conflict, which
broke out in the western region of Darfur in 2003, has displaced
nearly two million people and caused an estimated 200,000 to 400,000
deaths. The UN took command of the Darfur peacekeeping operation
from the African Union on 31 December 2007. As of early 2009,
peacekeeping troops were struggling to stabilize the situation,
which has become increasingly regional in scope and has brought
instability to eastern Chad. Sudan also has faced large refugee
influxes from neighboring countries primarily Ethiopia and Chad.
Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and lack of
government support have chronically obstructed the provision of
humanitarian assistance to affected populations.

Economy ::Sudan




Economy - overview:


Since 1997, Sudan has been working with the IMF to implement
macroeconomic reforms including a managed float of the exchange rate
and a large reserve of foreign exchange. A new currency, the
Sudanese Pound, was introduced in January 2007 at an initial
exchange rate of $1.00 equals 2 Sudanese Pounds. Sudan began
exporting crude oil in the last quarter of 1999 and the economy
boomed on the back of increases in oil production, high oil prices,
and significant inflows of foreign direct investment until the
second half of 2008. The Darfur conflict, the aftermath of two
decades of civil war in the south, the lack of basic infrastructure
in large areas, and a reliance by much of the population on
subsistence agriculture ensure much of the population will remain at
or below the poverty line for years to come despite rapid rises in
average per capita income. Sudan's real GDP expanded by 5.2% during
2010, an improvement over 2009's 4.2% growth but significantly below
the more that 10% per year growth experienced prior to the global
financial crisis in 2006 and 2007. While the oil sector continues to
drive growth, services and utilities play an increasingly important
role in the economy with agriculture production remaining important
as it employs 80% of the work force and contributes a third of GDP.
In the lead up to the referendum on southern secession, scheduled in
January 2011, Sudan saw its currency depreciate considerably on the
black market with the Central Bank's official rate also losing value
as the Sudanese people started to hoard foreign currency. The
Central Bank of Sudan intervened heavily in the currency market to
defend the value of the pound and the Sudanese government introduced
a number of measures to restrain excess local demand for hard
currency, but uncertainty ahead of the referendum has meant that
foreign exchange remained in heavy demand as 2010 came to a close.

Transnational Issues ::Sudan




Disputes - international:


the effects of Sudan's almost constant ethnic and rebel militia
fighting since the mid-20th century have penetrated all of the
neighboring states; as of 2006, Chad, Ethiopia, Kenya, Central
African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Uganda
provided shelter for over half a million Sudanese refugees, which
includes 240,000 Darfur residents driven from their homes by
Janjawid armed militia and the Sudanese military forces; Sudan, in
turn, hosted about 116,000 Eritreans, 20,000 Chadians, and smaller
numbers of Ethiopians, Ugandans, Central Africans, and Congolese as
refugees; in February 2006, Sudan and DROC signed an agreement to
repatriate 13,300 Sudanese and 6,800 Congolese; Sudan accuses
Eritrea of supporting Sudanese rebel groups; efforts to demarcate
the porous boundary with Ethiopia proceed slowly due to civil and
ethnic fighting in eastern Sudan; the boundary that separates Kenya
and Sudan's sovereignty is unclear in the "Ilemi Triangle," which
Kenya has administered since colonial times; Sudan claims but Egypt
de facto administers security and economic development of Halaib
region north of the 22nd parallel boundary; periodic violent
skirmishes with Sudanese residents over water and grazing rights
persist among related pastoral populations along the border with the
Central African Republic



Refugees and internally displaced persons:


refugees (country of origin): 157,220 (Eritrea); 25,023 (Chad);
11,009 (Ethiopia); 7,895 (Uganda); 5,023 (Central African Republic)

IDPs: 5.3 - 6.2 million (civil war 1983-2005; ongoing conflict in
Darfur region) (2007)



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Sudan is a source country for men, women, and
children trafficked internally for the purposes of forced labor and
sexual exploitation; Sudan is also a transit and destination country
for Ethiopian women trafficked abroad for domestic servitude;
Sudanese women and girls are trafficked within the country as well
as possibly to Middle Eastern countries for domestic servitude; the
terrorist rebel organization, Lord's Resistance Army, continues to
harbor small numbers of Sudanese and Ugandan children in the
southern part of the country for use as cooks, porters, and
combatants; some of these children are also trafficked across
borders into Uganda or the Democratic Republic of the Congo; militia
groups in Darfur, some of which are linked to the government, abduct
women for short periods of forced labor and to perpetrate sexual
violence; during the two decades-long north-south civil war,
thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently
enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes; while
there have been no known new abductions of Dinka by members of
Baggara tribes in the last few years, inter-tribal abductions
continue in southern Sudan

tier rating: Tier 3 - Sudan does not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
significant efforts to do so; combating human trafficking through
law enforcement or prevention measures was not a priority for the
government in 2007 (2008)
