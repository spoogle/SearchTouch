Trinidad and Tobago  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Trinidad and Tobago




Background:


First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British
control in the early 19th century. The islands' sugar industry was
hurt by the emancipation of the slaves in 1834. Manpower was
replaced with the importation of contract laborers from India
between 1845 and 1917, which boosted sugar production as well as the
cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added
another important export. Independence was attained in 1962. The
country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks
largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing.
Tourism, mostly in Tobago, is targeted for expansion and is growing.
The government is coping with a rise in violent crime.

Economy ::Trinidad and Tobago




Economy - overview:


Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent
investment site for international businesses and has one of the
highest growth rates and per capita incomes in Latin America.
Economic growth between 2000 and 2007 averaged slightly over 8%,
significantly above the regional average of about 3.7% for that same
period; however, GDP has slowed down since then and contracted about
3.5% in 2009, before rising more than 2% in 2010. Growth has been
fueled by investments in liquefied natural gas (LNG),
petrochemicals, and steel. Additional petrochemical, aluminum, and
plastics projects are in various stages of planning. Trinidad and
Tobago is the leading Caribbean producer of oil and gas, and its
economy is heavily dependent upon these resources but it also
supplies manufactured goods, notably food products and beverages, as
well as cement to the Caribbean region. Oil and gas account for
about 40% of GDP and 80% of exports, but only 5% of employment. The
country is also a regional financial center, and tourism is a
growing sector, although it is not as important domestically as it
is to many other Caribbean islands. The economy benefits from a
growing trade surplus. The previous MANNING administration benefited
from fiscal surpluses fueled by the dynamic export sector; however,
declines in oil and gas prices have reduced government revenues
which will challenge the new government's commitment to maintaining
high levels of public investment.
