Field Listing :: Major infectious diseases

  This entry lists major infectious diseases likely to be encountered
  in countries where the risk of such diseases is assessed to be very
  high as compared to the United States. These infectious diseases
  represent risks to US government personnel traveling to the
  specified country for a period of less than three years. The degree
  of risk is assessed by considering the foreign nature of these
  infectious diseases, their severity, and the probability of being
  affected by the diseases present. The diseases listed do not
  necessarily represent the total disease burden experienced by the
  local population.
  The risk to an individual traveler varies considerably by the
  specific location, visit duration, type of activities, type of
  accommodations, time of year, and other factors. Consultation with a
  travel medicine physician is needed to evaluate individual risk and
  recommend appropriate preventive measures such as vaccines.
  Diseases are organized into the following six exposure categories
  shown in italics and listed in typical descending order of risk.
  Note: The sequence of exposure categories listed in individual
  country entries may vary according to local conditions.
  food or waterborne diseases acquired through eating or drinking on
  the local economy:
  Hepatitis A - viral disease that interferes with the functioning of
  the liver; spread through consumption of food or water contaminated
  with fecal matter, principally in areas of poor sanitation; victims
  exhibit fever, jaundice, and diarrhea; 15% of victims will
  experience prolonged symptoms over 6-9 months; vaccine available.
  Hepatitis E - water-borne viral disease that interferes with the
  functioning of the liver; most commonly spread through fecal
  contamination of drinking water; victims exhibit jaundice, fatigue,
  abdominal pain, and dark colored urine.
  Typhoid fever - bacterial disease spread through contact with food
  or water contaminated by fecal matter or sewage; victims exhibit
  sustained high fevers; left untreated, mortality rates can reach 20%.
  vectorborne diseases acquired through the bite of an infected
  arthropod:
  Malaria - caused by single-cell parasitic protozoa Plasmodium;
  transmitted to humans via the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito;
  parasites multiply in the liver attacking red blood cells resulting
  in cycles of fever, chills, and sweats accompanied by anemia; death
  due to damage to vital organs and interruption of blood supply to
  the brain; endemic in 100, mostly tropical, countries with 90% of
  cases and the majority of 1.5-2.5 million estimated annual deaths
  occurring in sub-Saharan Africa.
  Dengue fever - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease
  associated with urban environments; manifests as sudden onset of
  fever and severe headache; occasionally produces shock and
  hemorrhage leading to death in 5% of cases.
  Yellow fever - mosquito-borne viral disease; severity ranges from
  influenza-like symptoms to severe hepatitis and hemorrhagic fever;
  occurs only in tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa, where
  most cases are reported; fatality rate is less than 20%.
  Japanese Encephalitis - mosquito-borne (Culex tritaeniorhynchus)
  viral disease associated with rural areas in Asia; acute
  encephalitis can progress to paralysis, coma, and death; fatality
  rates 30%.
  African Trypanosomiasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa
  Trypanosoma; transmitted to humans via the bite of bloodsucking
  Tsetse flies; infection leads to malaise and irregular fevers and,
  in advanced cases when the parasites invade the central nervous
  system, coma and death; endemic in 36 countries of sub-Saharan
  Africa; cattle and wild animals act as reservoir hosts for the
  parasites.
  Cutaneous Leishmaniasis - caused by the parasitic protozoa
  leishmania; transmitted to humans via the bite of sandflies; results
  in skin lesions that may become chronic; endemic in 88 countries;
  90% of cases occur in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
  Brazil, and Peru; wild and domesticated animals as well as humans
  can act as reservoirs of infection.
  Plague - bacterial disease transmitted by fleas normally associated
  with rats; person-to-person airborne transmission also possible;
  recent plague epidemics occurred in areas of Asia, Africa, and South
  America associated with rural areas or small towns and villages;
  manifests as fever, headache, and painfully swollen lymph nodes;
  disease progresses rapidly and without antibiotic treatment leads to
  pneumonic form with a death rate in excess of 50%.
  Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever - tick-borne viral disease;
  infection may also result from exposure to infected animal blood or
  tissue; geographic distribution includes Africa, Asia, the Middle
  East, and Eastern Europe; sudden onset of fever, headache, and
  muscle aches followed by hemorrhaging in the bowels, urine, nose,
  and gums; mortality rate is approximately 30%.
  Rift Valley fever - viral disease affecting domesticated animals and
  humans; transmission is by mosquito and other biting insects;
  infection may also occur through handling of infected meat or
  contact with blood; geographic distribution includes eastern and
  southern Africa where cattle and sheep are raised; symptoms are
  generally mild with fever and some liver abnormalities, but the
  disease may progress to hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, or ocular
  disease; fatality rates are low at about 1% of cases.
  Chikungunya - mosquito-borne (Aedes aegypti) viral disease
  associated with urban environments, similar to Dengue Fever;
  characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain
  usually lasting 3-7 days, some cases result in persistent arthritis.
  water contact diseases acquired through swimming or wading in
  freshwater lakes, streams, and rivers:
  Leptospirosis - bacterial disease that affects animals and humans;
  infection occurs through contact with water, food, or soil
  contaminated by animal urine; symptoms include high fever, severe
  headache, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea; untreated, the disease
  can result in kidney damage, liver failure, meningitis, or
  respiratory distress; fatality rates are low but left untreated
  recovery can take months.
  Schistosomiasis - caused by parasitic trematode flatworm
  Schistosoma; fresh water snails act as intermediate host and release
  larval form of parasite that penetrates the skin of people exposed
  to contaminated water; worms mature and reproduce in the blood
  vessels, liver, kidneys, and intestines releasing eggs, which become
  trapped in tissues triggering an immune response; may manifest as
  either urinary or intestinal disease resulting in decreased work or
  learning capacity; mortality, while generally low, may occur in
  advanced cases usually due to bladder cancer; endemic in 74
  developing countries with 80% of infected people living in
  sub-Saharan Africa; humans act as the reservoir for this parasite.
  aerosolized dust or soil contact disease acquired through inhalation
  of aerosols contaminated with rodent urine:
  Lassa fever - viral disease carried by rats of the genus Mastomys;
  endemic in portions of West Africa; infection occurs through direct
  contact with or consumption of food contaminated by rodent urine or
  fecal matter containing virus particles; fatality rate can reach 50%
  in epidemic outbreaks.
  respiratory disease acquired through close contact with an
  infectious person:
  Meningococcal meningitis - bacterial disease causing an inflammation
  of the lining of the brain and spinal cord; one of the most
  important bacterial pathogens is Neisseria meningitidis because of
  its potential to cause epidemics; symptoms include stiff neck, high
  fever, headaches, and vomiting; bacteria are transmitted from person
  to person by respiratory droplets and facilitated by close and
  prolonged contact resulting from crowded living conditions, often
  with a seasonal distribution; death occurs in 5-15% of cases,
  typically within 24-48 hours of onset of symptoms; highest burden of
  meningococcal disease occurs in the hyperendemic region of
  sub-Saharan Africa known as the "Meningitis Belt" which stretches
  from Senegal east to Ethiopia.
  animal contact disease acquired through direct contact with local
  animals:
  Rabies - viral disease of mammals usually transmitted through the
  bite of an infected animal, most commonly dogs; virus affects the
  central nervous system causing brain alteration and death; symptoms
  initially are non-specific fever and headache progressing to
  neurological symptoms; death occurs within days of the onset of
  symptoms.
