Argentina  (South America)

Introduction ::Argentina




Background:


In 1816, the United Provinces of the Rio Plata declared their
independence from Spain. After Bolivia, Paraguay, and Uruguay went
their separate ways, the area that remained became Argentina. The
country's population and culture were heavily shaped by immigrants
from throughout Europe, but most particularly Italy and Spain, which
provided the largest percentage of newcomers from 1860 to 1930. Up
until about the mid-20th century, much of Argentina's history was
dominated by periods of internal political conflict between
Federalists and Unitarians and between civilian and military
factions. After World War II, an era of Peronist populism and direct
and indirect military interference in subsequent governments was
followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy
returned in 1983 after a failed bid to seize the Falkland (Malvinas)
Islands by force, and has persisted despite numerous challenges, the
most formidable of which was a severe economic crisis in 2001-02
that led to violent public protests and the successive resignations
of several presidents.

Economy ::Argentina




Economy - overview:


Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly literate
population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
diversified industrial base. Although one of the world's wealthiest
countries 100 years ago, Argentina suffered during most of the 20th
century from recurring economic crises, persistent fiscal and
current account deficits, high inflation, mounting external debt,
and capital flight. A severe depression, growing public and external
indebtedness, and a bank run culminated in 2001 in the most serious
economic, social, and political crisis in the country's turbulent
history. Interim President Adolfo RODRIGUEZ SAA declared a default -
the largest in history - on the government's foreign debt in
December of that year, and abruptly resigned only a few days after
taking office. His successor, Eduardo DUHALDE, announced an end to
the peso's decade-long 1-to-1 peg to the US dollar in early 2002.
The economy bottomed out that year, with real GDP 18% smaller than
in 1998 and almost 60% of Argentines under the poverty line. Real
GDP rebounded to grow by an average 8.5% annually over the
subsequent six years, taking advantage of previously idled
industrial capacity and labor, an audacious debt restructuring and
reduced debt burden, excellent international financial conditions,
and expansionary monetary and fiscal policies. Inflation also
increased, however, during the administration of President Nestor
KIRCHNER, which responded with price restraints on businesses, as
well as export taxes and restraints, and beginning in early 2007,
with understating inflation data. Cristina FERNANDEZ DE KIRCHNER
succeeded her husband as President in late 2007, and the rapid
economic growth of previous years began to slow sharply the
following year as government policies held back exports and the
world economy fell into recession. The economy has rebounded from
the 2009 recession, but the government's continued reliance on
expansionary fiscal and monetary policies risks exacerbating already
high inflation, which remains under-reported by official statistics.

foreign investment encouraging the growth of modern
telecommunications technology; fiber-optic cable trunk lines are

entirely digital and the availability of telephone service is
improving

subscribership is increasing rapidly; broadband Internet services
are gaining ground

Transnational Issues ::Argentina




Disputes - international:


Argentina continues to assert its claims to the UK-administered
Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Georgia, and the South
Sandwich Islands in its constitution, forcibly occupying the
Falklands in 1982, but in 1995 agreed no longer to seek settlement
by force; territorial claim in Antarctica partially overlaps UK and
Chilean claims; unruly region at convergence of
Argentina-Brazil-Paraguay borders is locus of money laundering,
smuggling, arms and illegal narcotics trafficking, and fundraising
for extremist organizations; uncontested dispute between Brazil and
Uruguay over Braziliera/Brasiliera Island in the Quarai/Cuareim
River leaves the tripoint with Argentina in question; in 2006,
Argentina went to the ICJ to protest, on environmental grounds, the
construction of two pulp mills in Uruguay on the Uruguay River,
which forms the boundary; both parties presented their pleadings in
2007 with Argentina's reply in January and Uruguay's rejoinder in
July 2008; the joint boundary commission, established by Chile and
Argentina in 2001 has yet to map and demarcate the delimited
boundary in the inhospitable Andean Southern Ice Field (Campo de
Hielo Sur)



Illicit drugs:

some money-laundering activity, especially in the Tri-Border Area;
law enforcement corruption; a source for precursor chemicals;
increasing domestic consumption of drugs in urban centers,
especially cocaine base and synthetic drugs (2008)
