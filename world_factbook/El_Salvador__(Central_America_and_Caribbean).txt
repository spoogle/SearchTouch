Economy ::El Salvador




Economy - overview:


Despite being the smallest country geographically in Central
America, El Salvador has the third largest economy in the region.
The economy took a hit from the global recession and real GDP
contracted by 3.5% in 2009. The economy began a slow recovery in
2010 on the back of improved export and remittances figures.
Remittances accounted for 16% of GDP in 2009, and about a third of
all households receive these transfers. In 2006 El Salvador was the
first country to ratify the Dominican Republic-Central American Free
Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR), which has bolstered the export of
processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the
apparel sector amid increased Asian competition and the expiration
of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. El Salvador has promoted an
open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of
privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution,
banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the
Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million
compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the
country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the
civil war, through investments in education, public services,
enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the
adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost
control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response
to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained
by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any
international financing.
