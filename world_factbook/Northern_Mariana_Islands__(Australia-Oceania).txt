Northern Mariana Islands  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Northern Mariana Islands




Background:


Under US administration as part of the UN Trust Territory of the
Pacific, the people of the Northern Mariana Islands decided in the
1970s not to seek independence but instead to forge closer links
with the US. Negotiations for territorial status began in 1972. A
covenant to establish a commonwealth in political union with the US
was approved in 1975, and came into force on 24 March 1976. A new
government and constitution went into effect in 1978.

Economy ::Northern Mariana Islands




Economy - overview:


The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from
the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated
government revenues have grown. The key tourist industry employs
about 50% of the work force and accounts for roughly one-fourth of
GDP. Japanese tourists predominate. Annual tourist entries have
exceeded one-half million in recent years, but financial
difficulties in Japan have caused a temporary slowdown. The
agricultural sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms
producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Garment
production is by far the most important industry with the employment
of 17,500 mostly Chinese workers and sizable shipments to the US
under duty and quota exemptions.
