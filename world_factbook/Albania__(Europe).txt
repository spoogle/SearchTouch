Albania  (Europe)

Introduction ::Albania




Background:


Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912,
but was conquered by Italy in 1939. Communist partisans took over
the country in 1944. Albania allied itself first with the USSR
(until 1960), and then with China (to 1978). In the early 1990s,
Albania ended 46 years of xenophobic Communist rule and established
a multiparty democracy. The transition has proven challenging as
successive governments have tried to deal with high unemployment,
widespread corruption, a dilapidated physical infrastructure,
powerful organized crime networks, and combative political
opponents. Albania has made progress in its democratic development
since first holding multiparty elections in 1991, but deficiencies
remain. International observers judged elections to be largely free
and fair since the restoration of political stability following the
collapse of pyramid schemes in 1997; however, there have been claims
of electoral fraud in every one of Albania's post-communist
elections. In the 2005 general elections, the Democratic Party and
its allies won a decisive victory on pledges to reduce crime and
corruption, promote economic growth, and decrease the size of
government. The election, and particularly the orderly transition of
power, was considered an important step forward. Albania joined NATO
in April 2009 and is a potential candidate for EU accession.
Although Albania's economy continues to grow, the country is still
one of the poorest in Europe, hampered by a large informal economy
and an inadequate energy and transportation infrastructure.

Flag description:


red with a black two-headed eagle in the center; the design is
claimed to be that of 15th-century hero George Castriota
SKANDERBERG, who led a successful uprising against the Turks that
resulted in a short-lived independence for some Albanian regions
(1443-1478); an unsubstantiated explanation for the eagle symbol is
the tradition that Albanians see themselves as descendants of the
eagle; they refer to themselves as "Shkypetars," which translates as
"sons of the eagle"

Economy ::Albania




Economy - overview:


Albania, a formerly closed, centrally-planned state, is making the
difficult transition to a more modern open-market economy.
Macroeconomic growth averaged around 6% between 2004-08, but
declined to about 3% in 2009-10. Inflation is low and stable. The
government has taken measures to curb violent crime, and recently
adopted a fiscal reform package aimed at reducing the large gray
economy and attracting foreign investment. The economy is bolstered
by annual remittances from abroad representing about 15% of GDP,
mostly from Albanians residing in Greece and Italy; this helps
offset the towering trade deficit. The agricultural sector, which
accounts for over half of employment but only about one-fifth of
GDP, is limited primarily to small family operations and subsistence
farming because of lack of modern equipment, unclear property
rights, and the prevalence of small, inefficient plots of land.
Energy shortages because of a reliance on hydropower, and antiquated
and inadequate infrastructure contribute to Albania's poor business
environment and lack of success in attracting new foreign investment
needed to expand the country's export base. The completion of a new
thermal power plant near Vlore has helped diversify generation
capacity, and plans to upgrade transmission lines between Albania
and Montenegro and Kosovo would help relieve the energy shortages.
Also, with help from EU funds, the government is taking steps to
improve the poor national road and rail network, a long-standing
barrier to sustained economic growth.

100 per 100 persons

mobile-cellular phone service has been available since 1996; by
2003, two companies were providing mobile services at a greater
teledensity than some of Albania's neighbors; Internet broadband
services initiated in 2005; Internet cafes are popular in Tirana and
have started to spread outside the capital

international: country code - 355; submarine cable provides
connectivity to Italy, Croatia, and Greece; the Trans-Balkan Line, a
combination submarine cable and land fiber-optic system, provides

Transnational Issues ::Albania




Disputes - international:


the Albanian Government calls for the protection of the rights of
ethnic Albanians in neighboring countries, and the peaceful
resolution of interethnic disputes; some ethnic Albanian groups in
neighboring countries advocate for a "greater Albania," but the idea
has little appeal among Albanian nationals; the mass emigration of
unemployed Albanians remains a problem for developed countries,
chiefly Greece and Italy



Illicit drugs:


increasingly active transshipment point for Southwest Asian opiates,
hashish, and cannabis transiting the Balkan route and - to a lesser
extent - cocaine from South America destined for Western Europe;
limited opium and expanding cannabis production; ethnic Albanian
narcotrafficking organizations active and expanding in Europe;
vulnerable to money laundering associated with regional trafficking
in narcotics, arms, contraband, and illegal aliens
