Comoros  (Africa)

Introduction ::Comoros




Background:


Comoros has endured more than 20 coups or attempted coups since
gaining independence from France in 1975. In 1997, the islands of
Anjouan and Moheli declared independence from Comoros. In 1999,
military chief Col. AZALI seized power in a bloodless coup, and
helped negotiate the 2000 Fomboni Accords power-sharing agreement in
which the federal presidency rotates among the three islands, and
each island maintains its own local government. AZALI won the 2002
presidential election, and each island in the archipelago elected
its own president. AZALI stepped down in 2006 and President SAMBI
was elected to office. In 2007, Mohamed BACAR effected Anjouan's
de-facto secession from the Union, refusing to step down in favor of
fresh Anjouanais elections when Comoros' other islands held
legitimate elections in July. The African Union (AU) initially
attempted to resolve the political crisis by applying sanctions and
a naval blockade on Anjouan, but in March 2008, AU and Comoran
soldiers seized the island. The move was generally welcomed by the
island's inhabitants.

Economy ::Comoros




Economy - overview:


One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three
islands that have inadequate transportation links, a young and
rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy
dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, contributes 40% to GDP,
employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
Export income is heavily reliant on the three main crops of vanilla,
cloves, and ylang-ylang and Comoros' export earnings are easily
disrupted by disasters such as fires. The country is not
self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts
for the bulk of imports. The government - which is hampered by
internal political disputes - lacks a comprehensive strategy to
attract foreign investment and is struggling to upgrade education
and technical training, privatize commercial and industrial
enterprises, improve health services, diversify exports, promote
tourism, and reduce the high population growth rate. Political
problems have inhibited growth, which has averaged only about 1% in
2006-09. Remittances from 150,000 Comorans abroad help supplement
GDP. In September 2009 the IMF approved Comoros for a three-year $21
million loan. The IMF gave generally positive reports of the
country's program performance as of October 2010. The African
Development Bank approved a $34.6 million debt-relief package loan
for Comoros in September 2010, and Comoros will attempt to qualifry
for debt relief in 2012 under the IMF and World Bank's Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.
