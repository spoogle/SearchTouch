Macedonia  (Europe)

Introduction ::Macedonia




Background:


Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia in
1991. Greece's objection to the new state's use of what it
considered a Hellenic name and symbols delayed international
recognition, which occurred under the provisional designation of
"the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." In 1995, Greece lifted
a 20-month trade embargo and the two countries agreed to normalize
relations. The United States began referring to Macedonia by its
constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia, in 2004 and negotiations
continue between Greece and Macedonia to resolve the name issue.
Some ethnic Albanians, angered by perceived political and economic
inequities, launched an insurgency in 2001 that eventually won the
support of the majority of Macedonia's Albanian population and led
to the internationally-brokered Ohrid Framework Agreement, which
ended the fighting by establishing a set of new laws enhancing the
rights of minorities. Fully implementing the Framework Agreement and
stimulating economic growth and development continue to be
challenges for Macedonia, although progress has been made on both
fronts over the past several years.

Economy ::Macedonia




Economy - overview:


Having a small, open economy makes Macedonia vulnerable to economic
developments in Europe and dependent on regional integration and
progress toward EU membership for continued economic growth. At
independence in September 1991, Macedonia was the least developed of
the Yugoslav republics, producing a mere 5% of the total federal
output of goods and services. The collapse of Yugoslavia ended
transfer payments from the central government and eliminated
advantages from inclusion in a de facto free trade area. An absence
of infrastructure, UN sanctions on the downsized Yugoslavia, and a
Greek economic embargo over a dispute about the country's
constitutional name and flag hindered economic growth until 1996.
Since then, Macedonia has maintained macroeconomic stability with
low inflation, but it has so far lagged the region in attracting
foreign investment and creating jobs, despite making extensive
fiscal and business sector reforms. Official unemployment remains
high at 33%, but may be overstated based on the existence of an
extensive gray market, estimated to be more than 20% of GDP, that is
not captured by official statistics. In the wake of the global
economic downturn, Macedonia has experienced decreased foreign
direct investment, lowered credit, and a large trade deficit, but
the financial system remained sound. Macroeconomic stability was
maintained by a prudent monetary policy, which kept the domestic
currency at the pegged level against the euro, at the expense of
raising interest rates. As a result, GDP fell in 2009. but returned
to positive in 2010.
