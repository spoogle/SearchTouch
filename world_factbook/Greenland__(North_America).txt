Greenland  (North America)

Introduction ::Greenland




Background:


Greenland, the world's largest island, is about 81% ice capped.
Vikings reached the island in the 10th century from Iceland; Danish
colonization began in the 18th century, and Greenland was made an
integral part of Denmark in 1953. It joined the European Community
(now the EU) with Denmark in 1973 but withdrew in 1985 over a
dispute centered on stringent fishing quotas. Greenland was granted
self-government in 1979 by the Danish parliament; the law went into
effect the following year. Greenland voted in favor of increased
self-rule in November 2008 and acquired greater responsibility for
internal affairs in June 2009. Denmark, however, continues to
exercise control of Greenland's foreign affairs, security, and
financial policy in consultation with Greenland's Home Rule
Government.

Economy ::Greenland




Economy - overview:


The economy remains critically dependent on exports of shrimp and
fish and on a substantial subsidy - about $650 million in 2009 -
from the Danish Government, which supplies nearly 60% of government
revenues. The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises
and the municipalities, plays the dominant role in Greenland's
economy. Greenland's GDP contracted about 2% in 2009 as a result of
the global economic slowdown. Budget surpluses turned to deficits
beginning in 2007 and unemployment has risen. During the last decade
the Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) pursued conservative
fiscal and monetary policies, but public pressure has increased for
better schools, health care and retirement systems. The Greenlandic
economy has benefited from increasing catches and exports of shrimp,
Greenland halibut and, more recently, crabs. Due to Greenland's
continued dependence on exports of fish - which account for 82% of
exports - the economy remains very sensitive to foreign
developments. International consortia are increasingly active in
exploring for hydrocarbon resources off Greenland's western coast,
and international studies indicate the potential for oil and gas
fields in northern and northeastern Greenland. In May 2007 a US
aluminum producer concluded a memorandum of understanding with the
Greenland Home Rule Government to build an aluminum smelter and a
power generation facility, which takes advantage of Greenland's
abundant hydropower potential. Within the area of mining, olivine
sand continues to be produced and gold production has resumed in
south Greenland. Tourism also offers another avenue of economic
growth for Greenland, with increasing numbers of cruise lines now
operating in Greenland's western and southern waters during the peak
summer tourism season.
