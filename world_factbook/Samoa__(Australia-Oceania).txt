Samoa  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Samoa




Background:


New Zealand occupied the German protectorate of Western Samoa at the
outbreak of World War I in 1914. It continued to administer the
islands as a mandate and then as a trust territory until 1962, when
the islands became the first Polynesian nation to reestablish
independence in the 20th century. The country dropped the "Western"
from its name in 1997.

Economy ::Samoa




Economy - overview:


The economy of Samoa has traditionally been dependent on development
aid, family remittances from overseas, agriculture, and fishing. The
country is vulnerable to devastating storms. Agriculture employs
two-thirds of the labor force and furnishes 90% of exports,
featuring coconut cream, coconut oil, and copra. The manufacturing
sector mainly processes agricultural products. One factory in the
Foreign Trade Zone employs 3,000 people to make automobile
electrical harnesses for an assembly plant in Australia. Tourism is
an expanding sector accounting for 25% of GDP; 122,000 tourists
visited the islands in 2007. In late September 2009, an earthquake
and the resulting tsunami severely damaged Samoa, and nearby
American Samoa, disrupting transportation and power generation, and
resulting in about 200 deaths. The Samoan Government has called for
deregulation of the financial sector, encouragement of investment,
and continued fiscal discipline, while at the same time protecting
the environment. Observers point to the flexibility of the labor
market as a basic strength for future economic advances. Foreign
reserves are in a relatively healthy state, the external debt is
stable, and inflation is low.
