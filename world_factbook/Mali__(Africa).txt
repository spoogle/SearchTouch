Mali  (Africa)

Introduction ::Mali




Background:


The Sudanese Republic and Senegal became independent of France in
1960 as the Mali Federation. When Senegal withdrew after only a few
months, what formerly made up the Sudanese Republic was renamed
Mali. Rule by dictatorship was brought to a close in 1991 by a
military coup - led by the current president Amadou TOURE - enabling
Mali's emergence as one of the strongest democracies on the
continent. President Alpha KONARE won Mali's first democratic
presidential election in 1992 and was reelected in 1997. In keeping
with Mali's two-term constitutional limit, KONARE stepped down in
2002 and was succeeded by Amadou TOURE, who was subsequently elected
to a second term in 2007. The elections were widely judged to be
free and fair.

Economy ::Mali




Economy - overview:


Among the 25 poorest countries in the world, Mali is a landlocked
country highly dependent on gold mining and agricultural exports for
revenue. The country's fiscal status fluctuates with gold and
agricultural commodity prices and the harvest. Mali remains
dependent on foreign aid. Economic activity is largely confined to
the riverine area irrigated by the Niger River and about 65% of its
land area is desert or semidesert. About 10% of the population is
nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in farming and
fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on processing farm
commodities. The government has continued an IMF-recommended
structural adjustment program that has helped the economy grow,
diversify, and attract foreign investment. Mali is developing its
cotton and iron ore extraction industries to diversify its revenue
sources because gold production has started to fall. Mali has
invested in tourism but security issues are hurting the industry.
Mali's adherence to economic reform and the 50% devaluation of the
CFA franc in January 1994 have pushed up economic growth to a 5%
average in 1996-2010. Worker remittances and external trade routes
for the landlocked country have been jeopardized by continued unrest
in neighboring Cote d'Ivoire, however, Mali is building a road
network that will connect it to all adjacent countries and it has a
railway line to Senegal. In 2010, Mali experienced a regional
drought that hurt livestock and livelihoods.
