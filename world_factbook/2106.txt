Field Listing :: Maritime claims

  This entry includes the following claims, the definitions of which
  are excerpted from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the
  Sea (UNCLOS), which alone contains the full and definitive
  descriptions:
  territorial sea - the sovereignty of a coastal state extends beyond
  its land territory and internal waters to an adjacent belt of sea,
  described as the territorial sea in the UNCLOS (Part II); this
  sovereignty extends to the air space over the territorial sea as
  well as its underlying seabed and subsoil; every state has the right
  to establish the breadth of its territorial sea up to a limit not
  exceeding 12 nautical miles; the normal baseline for measuring the
  breadth of the territorial sea is the mean low-water line along the
  coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognized by the
  coastal state; the UNCLOS describes specific rules for archipelagic
  states.
  contiguous zone - according to the UNCLOS (Article 33), this is a
  zone contiguous to a coastal state's territorial sea, over which it
  may exercise the control necessary to: prevent infringement of its
  customs, fiscal, immigration, or sanitary laws and regulations
  within its territory or territorial sea; punish infringement of the
  above laws and regulations committed within its territory or
  territorial sea; the contiguous zone may not extend beyond 24
  nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the
  territorial sea is measured (e.g. the US has claimed a 12-nautical
  mile contiguous zone in addition to its 12-nautical mile territorial
  sea).
  exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - the UNCLOS (Part V) defines the EEZ
  as a zone beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea in which a
  coastal state has: sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and
  exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources, whether
  living or non-living, of the waters superjacent to the seabed and of
  the seabed and its subsoil, and with regard to other activities for
  the economic exploitation and exploration of the zone, such as the
  production of energy from the water, currents, and winds;
  jurisdiction with regard to the establishment and use of artificial
  islands, installations, and structures; marine scientific research;
  the protection and preservation of the marine environment; the outer
  limit of the exclusive economic zone shall not exceed 200 nautical
  miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial
  sea is measured.
  continental shelf - the UNCLOS (Article 76) defines the continental
  shelf of a coastal state as comprising the seabed and subsoil of the
  submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout
  the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of
  the continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from
  the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is
  measured where the outer edge of the continental margin does not
  extend up to that distance; the continental margin comprises the
  submerged prolongation of the landmass of the coastal state, and
  consists of the seabed and subsoil of the shelf, the slope and the
  rise; wherever the continental margin extends beyond 200 nautical
  miles from the baseline, coastal states may extend their claim to a
  distance not to exceed 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100
  nautical miles from the 2500 meter isobath; it does not include the
  deep ocean floor with its oceanic ridges or the subsoil thereof.
  exclusive fishing zone - while this term is not used in the UNCLOS,
  some states (e.g., the United Kingdom) have chosen not to claim an
  EEZ, but rather to claim jurisdiction over the living resources off
  their coast; in such cases, the term exclusive fishing zone is often
  used; the breadth of this zone is normally the same as the EEZ or
  200 nautical miles.

World
  a variety of situations exist, but in general, most countries
  make the following claims measured from the mean low-tide baseline
  as described in the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea:
  territorial sea - 12 nm, contiguous zone - 24 nm, and exclusive
  economic zone - 200 nm; additional zones provide for exploitation of
  continental shelf resources and an exclusive fishing zone; boundary
  situations with neighboring states prevent many countries from
  extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200 nm
