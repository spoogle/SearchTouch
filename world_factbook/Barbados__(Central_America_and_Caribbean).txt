Barbados  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Barbados




Background:


The island was uninhabited when first settled by the British in
1627. Slaves worked the sugar plantations established on the island
until 1834 when slavery was abolished. The economy remained heavily
dependent on sugar, rum, and molasses production through most of the
20th century. The gradual introduction of social and political
reforms in the 1940s and 1950s led to complete independence from the
UK in 1966. In the 1990s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the
sugar industry in economic importance.

Economy ::Barbados




Economy - overview:


Historically, the Barbadian economy was dependent on sugarcane
cultivation and related activities. However, in recent years the
economy has diversified into light industry and tourism with about
three-quarters of GDP and 80% of exports being attributed to
services. Growth has rebounded since 2003, bolstered by increases in
construction projects and tourism revenues, reflecting its success
in the higher-end segment, but the sector faced declining revenues
in 2009 with the global economic downturn. The country enjoys one of
the highest per capita incomes in the region. Offshore finance and
information services are important foreign exchange earners and
thrive from having the same time zone as eastern US financial
centers and a relatively highly educated workforce. The government
continues its efforts to reduce unemployment, to encourage direct
foreign investment, and to privatize remaining state-owned
enterprises. The public debt-to-GDP ratio rose to over 100% in 2009,
largely because a sharp slowdown in tourism and financial services
led to a wide budget deficit.
