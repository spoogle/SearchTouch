Cuba  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Cuba




Background:


The native Amerindian population of Cuba began to decline after the
European discovery of the island by Christopher COLUMBUS in 1492 and
following its development as a Spanish colony during the next
several centuries. Large numbers of African slaves were imported to
work the coffee and sugar plantations, and Havana became the
launching point for the annual treasure fleets bound for Spain from
Mexico and Peru. Spanish rule eventually provoked an independence
movement and occasional rebellions that were harshly suppressed. US
intervention during the Spanish-American War in 1898 assisted the
Cubans in overthrowing Spanish rule. The Treaty of Paris established
Cuban independence from the US in 1902 after which the island
experienced a string of governments mostly dominated by the military
and corrupt politicians. Fidel CASTRO led a rebel army to victory in
1959; his iron rule held the subsequent regime together for nearly
five decades. He stepped down as president in February 2008 in favor
of his younger brother Raul CASTRO. Cuba's Communist revolution,
with Soviet support, was exported throughout Latin America and
Africa during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The country faced a
severe economic downturn in 1990 following the withdrawal of former
Soviet subsidies worth $4 billion to $6 billion annually. Cuba at
times portrays the US embargo, in place since 1961, as the source if
its difficulties. Illicit migration to the US - using homemade
rafts, alien smugglers, air flights, or via the southwest border -
is a continuing problem. The US Coast Guard intercepted 982
individuals attempting to cross the Straits of Florida in fiscal
year 2009.

Economy ::Cuba




Economy - overview:


The government continues to balance the need for economic loosening
against a desire for firm political control. The government
announced it would eliminate 500,000 state jobs by March 2011 and
has expanded opportunities for self-employment. President CASTRO
said such changes were needed to update the economic model to ensure
the survival of socialism. It has rolled back limited reforms
undertaken in the 1990s to increase enterprise efficiency and
alleviate serious shortages of food, consumer goods, and services.
The average Cuban's standard of living remains at a lower level than
before the downturn of the 1990s, which was caused by the loss of
Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. Since late 2000, Venezuela
has been providing oil on preferential terms, and it currently
supplies about 100,000 barrels per day of petroleum products. Cuba
has been paying for the oil, in part, with the services of Cuban
personnel in Venezuela including some 30,000 medical professionals.

Telephone system:


general assessment: greater investment beginning in 1994 and the
establishment of a new Ministry of Information Technology and
Communications in 2000 has resulted in improvements in the system;
national fiber-optic system under development; 95% of switches
digitized by end of 2006; mobile-cellular telephone service is
expensive and must be paid in convertible pesos, which effectively
limits subscribership

domestic: fixed-line density remains low at less than 10 per 100
inhabitants; mobile-cellular service expanding but remains less than
5 per 100 persons

international: country code - 53; fiber-optic cable laid to but not
linked to US network; satellite earth station - 1 Intersputnik
(Atlantic Ocean region) (2009)



Broadcast media:


government owns and controls all broadcast media with private
ownership of electronic media prohibited; government operates 4
national TV networks and many local TV stations; government operates
6 national radio networks, an international station, and many local
radio stations; Radio-TV Marti is beamed from the US (2007)

Military - note:


the collapse of the Soviet Union deprived the Cuban military of its
major economic and logistic support and had a significant impact on
the state of Cuban equipment; the army remains well trained and
professional in nature; while the lack of replacement parts for its
existing equipment has increasingly affected operational
capabilities, Cuba remains able to offer considerable resistance to
any regional power (2010)







Transnational Issues ::Cuba




Disputes - international:


US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay is leased to US and only mutual
agreement or US abandonment of the facility can terminate the lease



Trafficking in persons:


current situation: Cuba is principally a source country for children
subjected to trafficking in persons, specifically commercial sexual
exploitation within the country; the scope of trafficking within
Cuba is difficult to gauge due to the closed nature of the
government and sparse non-governmental or independent reporting

tier rating: Tier 3 - Cuba does not fully comply with the minimum
standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making
significant efforts to do so; in a positive step, the Government of
Cuba shared information about human trafficking and its efforts to
address the issue; the government did not prohibit all forms of
trafficking during the reporting period, nor did it provide specific
evidence that it prosecuted and punished trafficking offenders,
protected victims of all forms of trafficking, or implemented victim
protection policies or programs to prevent human trafficking (2010)



Illicit drugs:


territorial waters and air space serve as transshipment zone for US-
and European-bound drugs; established the death penalty for certain
drug-related crimes in 1999 (2008)
