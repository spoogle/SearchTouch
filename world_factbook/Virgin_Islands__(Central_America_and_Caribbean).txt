Virgin Islands  (Central America and Caribbean)

Introduction ::Virgin Islands




Background:


During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided into two
territorial units, one English and the other Danish. Sugarcane,
produced by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th
and early 19th centuries. In 1917, the US purchased the Danish
portion, which had been in economic decline since the abolition of
slavery in 1848.

Economy ::Virgin Islands




Economy - overview:


Tourism is the primary economic activity, accounting for 80% of GDP
and employment. The islands hosted 2.4 million visitors in 2008. The
manufacturing sector consists of petroleum refining, rum distilling,
textiles, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and watch assembly. One of
the world's largest petroleum refineries is at Saint Croix. The
agricultural sector is small, with most food being imported.
International business and financial services are small but growing
components of the economy. The islands are vulnerable to substantial
damage from storms. The government is working to improve fiscal
discipline, to support construction projects in the private sector,
to expand tourist facilities, to reduce crime, and to protect the
environment.
