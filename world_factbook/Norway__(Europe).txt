Norway  (Europe)

Introduction ::Norway




Background:


Two centuries of Viking raids into Europe tapered off following the
adoption of Christianity by King Olav TRYGGVASON in 994. Conversion
of the Norwegian kingdom occurred over the next several decades. In
1397, Norway was absorbed into a union with Denmark that lasted more
than four centuries. In 1814, Norwegians resisted the cession of
their country to Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Sweden then
invaded Norway but agreed to let Norway keep its constitution in
return for accepting the union under a Swedish king. Rising
nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum
granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained neutral in
World War I, it suffered heavy losses to its shipping. Norway
proclaimed its neutrality at the outset of World War II, but was
nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940-45). In
1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO.
Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s
boosted Norway's economic fortunes. The current focus is on
containing spending on the extensive welfare system and planning for
the time when petroleum reserves are depleted. In referenda held in
1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU.

Economy ::Norway




Economy - overview:


The Norwegian economy is a prosperous bastion of welfare capitalism,
featuring a combination of free market activity and government
intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the vital
petroleum sector, through large-scale state-majority-owned
enterprises. The country is richly endowed with natural resources -
petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly
dependent on the petroleum sector, which accounts for nearly half of
exports and over 30% of state revenue. Norway is the world's
second-largest gas exporter; its position as an oil exporter has
slipped to ninth-largest as production has begun to decline. Norway
opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in November 1994;
nonetheless, as a member of the European Economic Area, it
contributes sizably to the EU budget. In anticipation of eventual
declines in oil and gas production, Norway saves almost all state
revenue from the petroleum sector in the world's second largest
sovereign wealth fund, valued at over $500 billion in 2010. After
lackluster growth of less than 1.5% in 2002-03, GDP growth picked up
to 2.5-6.2% in 2004-07, partly due to higher oil prices. Growth fell
to 1.8% in 2008, and the economy contracted by 1.4% in 2009 as a
result of the slowing world economy and the drop in oil prices.
