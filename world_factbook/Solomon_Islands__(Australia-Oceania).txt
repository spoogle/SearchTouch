Solomon Islands  (Australia-Oceania)

Introduction ::Solomon Islands




Background:


The UK established a protectorate over the Solomon Islands in the
1890s. Some of the most bitter fighting of World War II occurred on
this archipelago. Self-government was achieved in 1976 and
independence two years later. Ethnic violence, government
malfeasance, and endemic crime have undermined stability and civil
society. In June 2003, then Prime Minister Sir Allan KEMAKEZA sought
the assistance of Australia in reestablishing law and order; the
following month, an Australian-led multinational force arrived to
restore peace and disarm ethnic militias. The Regional Assistance
Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has generally been effective
in restoring law and order and rebuilding government institutions.

Economy ::Solomon Islands




Economy - overview:


The bulk of the population depends on agriculture, fishing, and
forestry for at least part of its livelihood. Most manufactured
goods and petroleum products must be imported. The islands are rich
in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc, nickel, and
gold. Prior to the arrival of RAMSI, severe ethnic violence, the
closing of key businesses, and an empty government treasury
culminated in economic collapse. RAMSI's efforts to restore law and
order and economic stability have led to modest growth as the
economy rebuilds.
